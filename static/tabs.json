{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little device!", "Author": "LuvAmazon", "ReviewID": "R1Q9HS45OIV1U3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned an Ipad 2, an original Kindle Fire, and first generation 3g dual screen Nook. I decided it was time to upgrade my original Nook and went with this tablet. I purchased mine direct from B&N.; This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7\" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N;'s Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better. It would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with. All in all, the Nook HD is a great device that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, and is worth serious consideration.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "best screen out of all 7\" tablets", "Author": "C.

It has the highest screen resolution for its form factor (7\") and is a pleasure to read and write with. Netflix & Hulu+ are magical to view since the resolution is so high and it's so darn light.

Fantastic! It is totally Android, hooked right into the Googleplex... like Google Maps, and the Google Play apps store... where, you guessed it, I immediately downloaded the free 'must-have' Amazon Kindle app, perfect! (I might buy the B&N; tablet, but books? Amazon all the way). And free Acrobat Reader, which will still enlarge any vector line art in a PDF to 6400%, just like on a PC/Mac. Note -- Flash and video embedded in a PDF do not play on the Nook, or, to my knowledge, on any other tablet, or on Macs.Let's see. Photos (originals are 1800 x 1200) shown from my Smugmug site are razor-sharp in perfect color on the 7\" Nook screen. I'm an amateur photographer, and it's a joy to see my images displayed absolutely correctly.Other stuff -- it has a microSD card slot so you can bring in your own pix, docs, PDFs, etc. Will buy a microSD card for it tomorrow. As an aside, there's a company called N2acards that sells a microSD card pre-loaded with the Android operating system... but, with the Nook HD 'in bed' with Google, I'm not sure what I'm missing by just sticking with the Nook's built-in system.Anyway, I'm VERY happy with this product. If it blows up, I can take it back to my local B&N; store and get another. And it has a feature where it backs up all your content on Google servers.Lastly, was able to connect it to my Yahoo e-mail account immediately. It also has Facebook and Twitter, but I turned them off as I'm fairly anti-social.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best tablet on the market.", "Author": "Arianastar", "ReviewID": "RCQN05WOOTYOI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used the Kindle HD and this Nook HD beat it by a mile!ProsBest picture quality.

A few days later I was at the mall with my girlfriend and I saw an add for the Nook hd and Nook Hd plus NOW WITH GOOGLE Market. It was enough to draw my attention in.  Once inside in saw another sign for the heavily reduced price tag on the Nook Hd and nook Hd plus. I thought man for the price of the one Kindle fire hd 8.9 I could get myself two of these nook hd with cases for about the same price.So that's what I did! I got my self the smoke (grey)  and my girlfriend a snow(white)  with two flip sleep/wake cases for under 300$. The screen is super nice full 1080p with the highest ppi on any tablet.  The only tablet that can compete Round the same price point is the nexus 7 and that's still 199$.With the addition of the Google market they have turned their nook Hd into a full fledged android tablet for 129$! That is a steal for a tablet this good.Beware of the 9 inch nook Hd plus.  Even though it's the big brother of the 7 inch nook Hd it still has the same processor and it shows. The plus is sluggish while the7 inch is zippy with very few lag issues. Not sure why this but beware it is noticeable.Over all we love it! Nook Hd does everything the Kindle fire hd does for the e readers PLUS more with the addition of the Google play store.If you want to change the way the original nook operating system looks for a Google nexus 7 look then I would suggest the nova launcher in the play store. Can't go wrong with the Nook hd 7 inch for 129$.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't give up on your NOOK HD just yet - make it a Lean Mean Jellybean with OS 4.2.2", "Author": "DC10", "ReviewID": "ROX6OFU4UAOK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi Folks, I Originally had this review in the 7\" 8Gb model, when I actually have the 16Gb model -This review is long, but it is so worth reading if you want to keep your NOOK HD or HD+.A couple of weeks ago I was going to throw my Nook HD 7\" on Ebay and get what I could for it and take the loss plain and simple - I was not using at all - often times setting for months one end, unused. The screen resolution was great, but the Android OS IceCream Sandwich was slow, cumbersome and basically not well thought out + the speaker volume was really low coupled with Adobe reader being super slow and note taking in Adobe Reader was also painful often causing the app to lock up or freeze, so I was extremely disappointed with the purchase that I made last fall at B&N; for $175. So, I started comparing the Nook to Nexus 7\" and thought what the heck - sell it and buy a used Nexus on Ebay -But, I came across some articles talking about ROOTED Nooks and the possibility of having them go to a full Android tablet, but this too sounded complicated, and after all, I just wanted to use my device like my wife's Ipad Mini - Well after doing a little more research found this website N2A which had Jellybean OS 4.1.2 for download $19.99 - I paid for that - and thought wow what a nice difference for my NOOK HD, Now moving forward several months - I thought, I was going to keep it at 4.1.2, but my BlueTooth only worked so, so and the Wifi was not as snappy as I wanted it to be - Once again I decided what the heck, so as of this early week, I took the plunge and moved it to Android 4.2.2 for $9.99 more on the AFN Website (Android for NOOK, I thought what the heck, 10 bucks more and what can it hurt)...WOW with the 4.2.2 upgrade it is absolutely stellar - I mean it is fantastico - Snappy and fast, honest, and BlueTooth and WiFi are much, much faster with 4.2.2 - AND The Volume, yes the Volume finally is loud enough and I even have to now turn it down - Can you believe it folks, Watching TV, Movies internet Videos are now actually enjoyable - Check out my review for Android for NOOK (AFN) here on Amazon...  and my review for the Minisuite stand and case+keyboard...OH but this is supposed to be a review about the NOOK HD 7\" 16GB, right! Right! -As far as the Nook itself, it is still the best thing out price point wise, Honest,  they are so much cheaper than a lot of Android Tablets, and a lot cheaper then an Ipad Mini or even a used Ipad Mini -The Nook looks great for watching movies, surfing the web, doing my homework reading for grad school, and rivals my wife's Ipad mini any day of the week when it comes to movies on Netflix. Now, I type notes from class on my nook - read, do everything on it -Again much of this can be attributed to Jellybean OS 4.2.2 - I love reading books on my Nook, and I really appreciate the outside cover of the Nook HD (some thought went into this, plastic kinda rubber cover, that works great). I throw this thing everywhere, on the couch, then bounces and hits the floor, it has even dropped out of my hands or off the kitchen counter with no damage at all -Look, I don't need a camera on my tablet - That's not why I bought my nook originally, I bought to watch movies on in bed with the wife and TV episodes on Netflix - I now use it several times a week as a reader and note taker for homework. So, what are you waiting for, go out and buy a nook HD 7\" or 9\" - they are wicked cheap new, and close to Ebay prices, if the ebay thing is not for you - and have some Jellybeans too.Now remember - I can go back to my lame B&N; original OS if I want to, just by taking the micro SD card out , but of course, I won't -Only if BARNES AND NOBLE WOULD UPDATE THEIR NOOKS TO JELLYBEAN 4.2.2 the world would be a much better place. What, the What B&N;!!! Why won't you guys have an update for JellyBean on the NOOK? Why I ask, Why?In the end I might even buy a Nook HD+ on ebay and obviously throw some Jellybeans on that too - because they are so wicked cheap on Ebay right now, and because you have tons of people just simply selling theirs...I hope this helped some current nook owners - and future ones -", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet On A Budget!", "Author": "Perry", "ReviewID":

It would be her first one, so I thought I'd get her a nicer one that she'd probably buy herself as a Christmas gift. After doing the research and speaking with owners of both the Nook HD and Kindle Fire, I went with the Nook. Then in conversation with my fiance, she basically said she'd taking the gift cards that her students gave her to buy a Kindle (much to my dismay). In her mind, she thought the basic model Kindle was better than the basic Nook. So I had to spoil the surprise so she wouldn't buy the Kindle.

One book was not found and after an hour on the phone, BN said the publisher stopped making it available for the Nook (is available for the Kindle) and will issue a refund. Fortunately I kept the email confirmations of all books I ordered so I could give them the order number.Customer service is lacking at BN. I had to make multiple calls until I was finally put in touch with someone who could solve the problem of the missing book.One other thing-update seems to have changed screen brightness as before I could read it out by the pool and now I no longer can.In fairness, I will also mention that I have a Kindle paperwhite and an update wiped out my created collections, but didn't lose any books and can still read it out by the pool.Both have Wi-Fi and that may be an inherent problem with updating through it as far as shelves/collections go.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nook HD has a lot to offer", "Author": "sal \"salby\"", "ReviewID": "R2HAW1NKZK7VCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is too bad that the Nook HD hasn't received more kudos.

Recentley i purchased a tablet and really enjoyed that you could read books with a backlight and in color, beacause of that i went on the hunt for a color ebook. Now when Barnes and Noble started to come out with their ebooks I did not like them, I didnt like the desgin, when i would mess with them at Barnes and Nobel they just seemed redundant and to annoying to work with.  So When the Nook HD came out i researched and fell in love, I am soo happy i made this purchase.  I did not buy it from amazon as my local Kmart had it for 199.00 and you were able to put it in lay-a-way.  Some of the features this product needed to have were expandable memory, and screen functions to turn down backlight and make font bigger when needed. The screen resolution on this item in really nice, the touch screen is super responsive and the quality of the reading and easyness of use makes this an everyone can use product.  It is called a tablet and can be used that way, as you can get on the internet, access email, and also watch netflix if you choose but i wanted a color ebook not a smaller tablet so i really cant tell you how well it works as a tablet. I can tell you if you are looking for a good color Ereader this is the one i would recomend, like i said it is easy to use litteraly two pushes to open a book or access library page flipping is easy and controlls to make fonts larger or smaller, change paper color, even change font appearence are easy.  Also Barnes and Noble stores books on the cloud network for you when you take them off of you shelf. Magazines are interactive, and picture books for children are vibrant and enjoyable.  You can add up to 32gb of extra memory in micro miny memory card slot and the battery i have found if you turn off wifi can last you up to 2-3 weeks.  My sony lasted me about 1-2 months on a single charge so the two to three weeks is not that bad for me.

The warranty had already expired, so there was nothing left to do except take a shot in the dark and try and heat the metal connectors of the chipset so they became reattached to the motherboard (there are youtube videos describing the procedure - not for the faint of heart).  It lasted a week, and came across the same problem.  Luckily this doesn't affect the hard drive, so all the information was safe.HP:Classless.  Okay, Nvidia gives you a faulty chipset and you install it into several different versions of your laptops - I'll be more merciful than anyone and overlook that, but at least have the respect for your customers to acknowledge the problem (which HP still refuses to do), and do something to keep your customers (which they wrongly assume will stick around).  I have HP stuff all over the house, but no more.

They are the ones who, for less than $100 (includes shipping both ways) guarantee they can fix it. They can be found on eBay as well. Hope this review has been helpful. Good luck and God's blessing.

{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Step Closer", "Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "R3MU84B6T9NYD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPad pros and cons", "Author": "Larry J. Crockett", "ReviewID": "R4VCE1TBRME86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply don't like iPads from a distance, without actually owning one, because they see it as part of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful.  They're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation.I have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I don't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple.I have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality.  You should ask yourself, \"What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to have solved?\"  Software is always more important than hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression.The iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book.  You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I don't believe they will ever be what it is best at.  It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn.  Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop.  It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent.  The apps are either free or reasonably priced, so you can get a bunch from the \"app store\" for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one.This would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren.  The iPad is not a light laptop; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production.In my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another.  It \"knows\" where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly.  At this point in time, we should expect no less.  I cannot address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only (I am not convinced of the value of the 3G and I can use my phone as a hotspot).  I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step.  This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows.For the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement.  I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college.  But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27\" desktop which is the right environment for such development; I wouldn't expect to do that on an iPad.  In education (and evidently in medicine), it is proving to be a real boon.  The enterprise situations where portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution.  The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop.I purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50\" screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run.  It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV.  Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control.Before people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of computing solutions. I fear some of the evaluations here (both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well.  So read these reviews with a critical eye.October 18 2011 Update:I continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments.  I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do.  I use it 3 or 4 hours a day.I just ordered my wife an 11\" MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review.  I don't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is an excellent typist and likes the feel of the Air's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad: an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight.  The 11\" Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows.The Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device (iPad) and a production device (Air).  Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It's not the solution I want since I don't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device in my favorite love seat or use it to assist my teaching in class.  My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption.I guess we will give the phrase \"mixed marriage\" new meaning!", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's cool, but has its flaws - and do you really need one?", "Author": "J. Harvey", "ReviewID": "R1YNKZ8Y1IOMEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first: I consider myself relatively unbiased on Apple products. I received the original iPad as a gift (which I was able to return once I saw the iPad 2 announcement) and I have an old iPod 4th gen with color display which is still going strong after a few years, but aside from that I typically use Windows PCs and my phone is Android.If you don't have an iPad, and you're trying to decide whether you want one or not, ask yourself: What will I use this for?This is meant to be an overview for the uninitiated, since according to initial news reports, 70% of people who have bought the iPad 2 so far didn't own an original iPad.Advantages:If you want it for web surfing, a portable Netflix or other video screen, gaming, or FaceTime/Skype video chat, it's definitely adept at all of those things. I used to read books and magazines in my bed before going to sleep, and I still occasionally do, but now I've found that surfing with the iPad is just as convenient and relaxing.The iPad is all about the apps, many of which greatly expand the native capability of the iPad. You can get Microsoft Office clones, remote desktop, second screen, calculators, alarm clocks, remote apps for cable boxes and disc players, and more. Some are free, many are not. I'll get into some of those a bit later, but keep in mind this isn't intended to be a review of apps. If you want to see what's out there, you can search the App store on the web or in iTunes. If you expect the iPad to be able to do something not in its specs, check the app store first.The only difference I've seen with the iPad 2 is that now there are a few games out there that are optimized for iPad 2, or have improved iPad 2 modes. Lots of games are free and those that aren't occasionally go on sale. The only two I've bought are Scrabble HD and Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, both when they were $1 each. (I've played many more free ones.) I recommend both. Dungeon Hunter 2 HD is a great 3D game that tries really hard to be Diablo 2, with character classes, customization, and online play. It looks great and has never crashed or had a framerate stutter. The iPad 1 had problems with crashing and low framerates with games occasionally, and this version seems to be a much better gaming system. That's the only big difference I noticed between the iPad 1 and iPad 2 so far though.For me, having a huge array of apps to play with, many of which are free if you don't mind ads here and there, and the convenience of being able to web surf without having to drag out my laptop makes this worth having. Plus the battery gets 8-10 hours on a charge, which is a far cry better than any laptop I know of. It's a great e-reader for airplane travel, even really long flights, though you can't use it on take-off and landing of course.Wi-Fi performance is flawless and the range is excellent. More than once I've pulled up in the driveway and before I'm even in the house, I've heard my iPad's ESPN ScoreCenter app go off to inform me of a score. I can't speak to the 3G quality, though, as I don't have that model. Frankly, I don't think most people need it. If I'm out of the middle of nowhere and need the web for something, I'd much rather pull out my phone than the iPad. If you just have to use the iPad, tons of public places have Wi-Fi these days.If you want to be able to print things, you might think at first that you need an AirPrint compatible printer. Fear not! A simple Google search for \"AirPrint any printer\" will show you how to configure your PC or Mac to broadcast its printers with AirPrint. I have Brother and Canon printers and they both worked with it. It took some time to download and install the AirPrint service and then configure printer sharing options on my network, but that was a far cry better than buying a new printer or an expensive printing app! Still, I've found that my printers occasionally disappear from the list, and the only way to get them back is to shut the iPad down completely and power it back on. Annoying.Limitations:The iPad 2 still doesn't support Adobe Flash. Some websites are adapting to this and adding HTML 5 video. Many aren't. Keep that in mind if you're a heavy web video user. I love to watch web shows like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd, and most web show hosting sites are still in Flash. Also, some sites have flash menus, making them completely unusable to you if they don't have a mobile version. It's this that prevents the iPad from being a true laptop replacement, regardless of how much you spend on apps. I still end up having to fire up the laptop to use several websites I enjoy.The screen is supposedly oleophobic but gets fingerprints all over the place in mere minutes of use. I find that extremely irritating. If you feel the same way, get a screen protector like the ZAGG InvisibleShield (though if you get that particular one, be VERY careful when you install it, it's extremely difficult to get it on there with no air bubbles). You will thank yourself when all it takes to clear fingerprints is one wipe, plus it protects from scratches to boot. To get fingerprints off the screen itself took vigorous scrubbing and left streaks, which needed isopropyl alcohol to remove. Also, in direct sunlight, the glare off the screen makes it hard to see. Add fingerprints to that and it's practically impossible.Although the iPad 2 has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, I haven't found much reason to use them other than for video chat. The cameras are terrible quality and the iPad 2 just isn't portable enough to drag around everywhere for camera usage. You can get an excellent digital camera for $150 or less, and most smartphones have much better cameras than the iPad has. Use one of those instead.If you don't own a laptop, don't expect the iPad 2 to do everything a laptop will, especially if you plan on doing any work-related things. Office applications are not included. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which are like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint respectively, are available for $10 each. I don't own them, but apparently they work reasonably well. However they are not 100% compatible with Microsoft Office documents, especially if you have more complicated formatting, macros, or animations that don't translate directly. Plus, the virtual keyboard is a bit more tiring to type on and definitely hinders typing speed. I average about 45-50 WPM on it, where I can get 80-100 WPM on a normal keyboard. You can be a little lazy with it to increase your effective typing speed, though; you can leave out apostrophes or required capitalization and the iPad will nearly always fix it. That also mostly takes care of my fingers occasionally hitting the wrong keys due to the lack of tactile feedback, but I still end up having to go back and fix words sometimes. Also, sometimes it fixes things that don't need to be fixed. It always seems to correct \"its\" to \"it's\", but what if I mean \"its\"? I know the difference!A lot of other features that you would expect a laptop to have are not here, though, or cost more. For example...- You can give slideshow presentations or display video on external monitors, projectors, or TVs with it, but that will cost you $29 for a VGA adapter plus the price of a cable and DVI to VGA adapter (monitors or projectors), or $39 for an HDMI adapter plus the price of an HDMI cable (newer TVs), or $39 for a composite or component video cable (older TVs)- You can transfer photos from a camera directly without having to use iTunes, but that will cost $29 for a camera adapter kit- The iPad is terrible at file storage for things other than music, videos, photos and apps, and with no USB or SD card slot, can't easily use external storage. If you want to store documents or need external storage for anything you'll need a file management app to keep track of them, and an online cloud file storage service like MobileMe (expensive) or Dropbox (free but limited to 2 GB, or pay for more)- Where you can just close a laptop to protect its screen, you'll need a case to protect the iPad. I highly recommend getting one. To save some money, try a cover/case intended for iPad 1, assuming you don't care that the rear camera will be covered up. A lot of them still fit and work great, such as the Griffin Elan Passport for iPad - Black, and since they're for an old model they'll be discounted- You can watch videos/TV episodes/movies on it, but unless you bought them in iTunes, it's a big fat pain to find a converter for them and transfer them to iTunes. This is especially annoying for DVDs/Blu-Rays that have digital copy. You've already paid for the movie and have a digital file but you can't transfer it to your iPad without having to jump through a ton of hoops or buying expensive programs or apps! Not all media companies have this problem, though. When you redeem a digital copy from Disney, you can choose to get an iTunes version, which is perfectly compatible with the iPad. I have Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E, and getting them on the iPad was hassle-free. Conversely, Warner Brothers only offers Windows Media versions of the Harry Potter series for digital copy. Transferring to iPad is possible but you need to find programs that remove the DRM, resize to iPad resolution, and convert to Quicktime format. Good luck with that.Despite all that, the iPad 2 is worth getting if you can spare the cash, and more importantly, if you anticipate actually using it. I don't think it's worth getting for games alone, but if you're a gamer, there are lots of great, cheap games out there. Many of them are even multiplayer, though I haven't tried it, since most of my friends don't have iPads and interoperability between iPad and iPhone versions of games is slim to none (board games like Scrabble and Carcassonne tend to support iPad/iPhone interoperability though).The thing is, though, I got this as a gift. Would I have gotten it if I actually had to plunk down the $500+? Honestly, probably not. The lack of many features without having to buy expensive apps and accessories is a real deal-breaker for me (and subtracts a star from my rating). Plus, though I understand why Apple doesn't like Adobe Flash, they really need to get over it since there are large parts of the web that don't work without it. It may be bad for battery life, but why not just have the option to turn it on and off as needed, then? Still, if money is no object for you, it's a slick, entertaining device, and you'll enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't expect it to replace anything you already have; the iPad is in a niche market that the iPad itself created.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comparison of my IPad 2 with my Xoom", "Author": "A", "ReviewID": "R3RXN27YVJW4VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased both an iPad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.External appearance and feel:The iPad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the iPad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the iPad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.Both weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.  UPDATE:  I need to learn to use the scales - the Xoom is about 3 ounces heavier than the iPad2.Both have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for iPad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the iPad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The iPad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.Hardware performance:The Xoom feels a bit faster than the iPad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the iPad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.User Interface:The iPad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the iPad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.Operating System:The iPad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.Applications:iPad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the iPad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the iPad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  If this doesn't improve quickly, the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.Browsing:Because of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the iPad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the iPad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with iPad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.Camera:I don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the iPad2 owner says the iPad2.  The Xoom has flash and iPad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.Speakers:The Xoom has two small speakers, iPad2 has one slightly larger speaker.  The sound is somewhat better quality on the iPad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the iPad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.Battery life:Difficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the iPad2 has the edge here, but not by much.Internal storage:The Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The iPad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.External storage:The Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The iPad2 has no external storage support.User Experience:The iPad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to iTunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.The Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.Support:Apple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both iPad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the iPad2.Bottom line:I believe the Xoom hardware may be slightly better than the iPad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.If I had to pick just one, I'd pick the iPad2 - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has potential but it's not there yet.  And by the time it gets there, there will be something better available.Update 7/5/2011We have now had the two devices for over 3 months.  During that time Motorola released an update to fix some of the issues with the original Xoom.  It's somewhat faster, the problem of only seeing the first 5 applications is fixed, there are some extra capabilities for USB, and most importantly, the Xoom doesn't crash every few hours.However, the biggest issue with the Xoom is still the number of applications available to run in native tablet mode, as opposed to running Android phone applications.  I've read that there are 300 applications available, but it's hard to find them.  The Android Market doesn't distinguish between phone applications designed for a small screen  and tablet applications.  You have to read the description of each application to see what it is designed to run on, and finding 300 apps in 200,000 is very time consuming.  Apple claims to have 100,000 iPad specific apps in their store.Another problem with the Android Market is the complete lack of supervision.  I understand that anybody can put any application there without any review, and I've read there have been a few problems with malware.  Recently I saw an article that claimed there are spyware applications on the store, which worries me a little.  I'm not saying you can't get malware from the Apple store, but Apple does look at the apps first - I'm not aware of any malware getting into the Apple store.The iPad2 does have some downsides I wasn't aware of when I wrote my review.  It would be nice to have a general purpose USB connection and a card slot.  There is an extra-cost adapter available from Apple that supplies HDMI out and a limited function USB connector.  Also the keyboard attachment made for the original iPad doesn't work on the iPad2.For us, the iPad2 is the winner.  The Xoom is sitting on a shelf and I don't think it's been used over a week now.  In contrast, iPad2 is in use every day and continues to be a big hit.  The primary problem with the Xoom is the lack of tablet-based applications.Update 7/7/2011The Xoom has been sold to a colleague who wants an Android tablet.  I think the Xoom is better than most of the Android tablets currently available.  However, the Honeycomb software feels so unfinished, and the paucity of available tablet-based applications was a major issue.  I lost several hundred dollars on the sale, but nobody wanted to use it and there was no point in letting it lay around unused.  I'm already under some pressure to buy another iPad2, but I want to wait to see if the rumors of another iPad version in September are true.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Went from \"why do I need it\" to \"Can't live without it\"", "Author": "C. A. Sinclair \"doctorcreation\"", "ReviewID": "R1FENBQH0LHSET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SUMMARY: White iPad 2 64GB Wifi-onlyA really wonderful electronic device for media consumption with some moderate content creation potential. This will likely change as more apps focused on content generation are created.  I find myself using it more and more simply because it is \"always ready\" and small enough that it is always near. If this device had a better file management system and a more robust way to share printers it would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars. As it is, the iPad 2 is a solid 4 star device.DELIGHTERS (Current features that exceeded my expectations)FORM FACTOR: Thin and comfortable to hold. Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to \"remember\" to do \"that thing\" the next time you're at your computer. Still has some weight to it (1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue.APP ENVIRONMENT: Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets.SLEEP MODE: It is seemingly \"always ready\" as it wakes from sleep very quickly.HDMI OUT: Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience.iOS: Overall the operating system is \"cleanly\" designed, features are easy to navigate and find.PROCESSING SPEED: Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc.SATISFIERS (Current features that met my expectation)HOMESHARING: Being able to share my iTunes library (music, movies, podcast, etc)  across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2.SCREEN: Bright, good touch sensitivity, \"flips\" between orientations well, handles pictures and text with aplomb.PRICE: Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a \"real\" laptopAUDIO: Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing.BATTERY LIFE: Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage)WIFI: This simply \"works\". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings.ONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a \"tab\" button really disrupts workflow.DISSATISFIERS (Current features that did not meet my expectations)FILE MANAGEMENT: File management on the iPad is Byzantine. You use iTunes to \"attach\" files to apps or email them?PRINTING: Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer (new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious \"file management\" system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain!CAMERAS: The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I wouldn't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like \"GeniusScan\" to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of \"barely legible\" documents.COST PER GB: Paying >$3 per GB ($100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive.TOUCH NAVIGATION: Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having \"grown up\" using keyboards and mice to interface with computers I am having to learn how to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click.WISHLIST (features I'd like to see in the next-gen iPad)Touchscreen: The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a \"fat\" stylus isn't one of them. Having a touch screen that doesn't require the \"fat\" stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking.USB or SD Card ports (never gonna happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it doesn't hurt to dream)Retina displayInfrared receiver/transmitter (Can anyone say universal remote!)GPSCheaper 3G antenna: $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I gotta buy a plan? ugh.Smartcover: Would like to see this included in the price of the device", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A few things that haven't been covered...", "Author": "Expert Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1HDDISACYGGRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're considering a tablet, the only rational choice is the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Anything else you there is too expensive/too buggy/lacking support/etc. As someone who owns a desktop but no laptop, the iPad 2 is just perfect. A laptop would often be redundant, though it would be handy for working outside of the home.  With the iPad, I will use it all the time both in the home and elsewhere.I will try to add some comments that haven't been covered:* I find that 16gb is fine, though this may change if app sizes get much larger. I don't intend to store my music or a bunch of videos on this. Videos can be streamed, or added as-needed, and I rely on DropBox to store files - it lets me view and edit files between my desktop and my iPad.* Part of the reason the iPad is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat.* It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems (I think that the Macbook Airs similarly will never overheat). You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.* Terrific value. All hype aside, the design, durability and capability of an iPad 2 is such that I would expect to pay much more. You can find a cheap laptop for the same price, and it will be capable of much more. However, the iPad will accomplish 95% of what you want to do on a computer, and will open doors (via apps) to new and totally unexpected experiences.* Browsing the web is better on the iPad. At least, it often is. It's certainly better to take your iPad on the couch than to hunch over a laptop on the coffee table. Though the screen is small compared to a desktop screen, it's equivalent to working on a bigger screen because of how close you will be. Scrolling and navigating a webpage with your hand is a qualitatively better experience than using the tools we've become accustomed to (mouse, trackball or trackpad). I guess that's why sci-fi movies always depict computers with touch interfaces in the future. Moving the page around and adjusting the size of everything by hand never gets old.* Just like with my iPhone 4, I rarely sync my iPad 2. I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. I can sync occasionally to back-up my apps. I don't use iTunes to manage files (again, I rely on Dropbox). Dropbox and Evernote are must-have apps on all my computers and portable devices.* Safari can use some work. I prefer the tabbed browsing, not having to switch windows. There are some alternative browsers (I bought 360 Browser, which is good), but Apple won't let me select those as my default browser. I don't use Safari on my desktop, but even if I wanted to sync my passwords and history, I don't think it'll let me (it will sync bookmarks through iTunes though). I really wish Apple would loosen up so that Firefox or Chrome would be available, and that one of those could be my default.* As cool as the smart cover is, I spent my money on a wireless keyboard instead. I really don't think the smart cover is going to make a difference as long as I take other measures to protect my screen. I may skip the HDMI adapter as well - it would be fun, but there is never a time that I will need to project my iPad on my HDTV.In summary, if you think you'd like it, you'll probably love it. If you are just kinda curious but content with your current set-up, you can save yourself the money. For the same price, you can get an adequate laptop running Windows 7.

I am middle- aged, love my nano, a kindle devotee from the first days, don't have a smart phone, and am a pc user.  at first i was awed by the touchscreen and the resolution quality.  images are gorgeous.  but now, it is really annoying.  too often the screen doesn't respond, and then reacts when you don't even know you're touching it.  the word processing function has been limited and limiting from the start, for someone accustomed to microsoft.if you think in buying the ipad you are getting a  compact, fast, light computer, you are not.  it IS fast.  a computer it is not.  no flash player is definitely a hinderance.  what it is great for is apps, games, (although the screen has been frustrating there too), watching movies and tv shows,  some browsing on the internet, and as a portable photo album, because images are truly fantastic on the ipad.  i find the screen very fatiguing on my eyes, and have the brightness level down almost as far as it can go.  i would never dream of reading a book on it.  kindle has nothing to worry about, as far as the ipad as a reading device.  the fact i can't see the ipad  screen outside, even in the shade, is also unfortunate, but i get it, that's a backlit screen.i am submitting this review not to bash apple, but to clarify a bit to people not familiar with macs and/or touchscreens what this device is about.  would i buy this device again? not unless it sold for maybe $300.  it is more a toy than a tool.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.", "Author": "carol irvin \"carol irvin\"", "ReviewID": "RFX4JZ7CUL8NY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The biggest change in our lives so far with the arrival of our iPad 2 is now that we have three of them, no one is without an ipad 24/7.

We are a husband and wife in our 60s plus my husband's mother who is 100 years old. She is curled up with the iPad almost all day long as her ability to do anything active has all but vanished. She goes easily  from reading a Danielle Steele ebook to watching a Prince William and Kate lifetime movie.The above is both versions of the iPad's biggest virtue: ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.  Both my husband and I are techie types so we are quite expert on computers.  Friends in our age range usually are not.  My advice to every one of them is \"buy an ipad.\"  It puts those with low tech abilities on an even playing field because they do everything with their fingers and visually.  It is the supreme compliment to say about either iPad, \"any idiot can use it.\"Right now you can't buy an iPad 1.  We were going to buy a third one of those on sale but they sold out so fast that we had to get the iPad 2 as our third one.  My husband is the one who appreciates subtle refinements in electronics.  He has been in seventh heaven since it arrived.  Truthfully, my mother in law and I, as long as we can get on it and read our books, watch our movies, assemble recipes in our app cookbook, and so forth and so on, are happy as can be and both iPad versions do that extremely well.  My husband is the one who waxes rhapsodically over lighter weight, better LED screen, improved battery life, and so forth.  Like most reviewers of iPad 2 he concludes that it is a beautiful evolution but not a revolution from the first iPad.For those of you with extended families elsewhere, there are other new features which could be huge features for you.  The ability now to visit with family members by video with your ipad 2 are completely built in.  It has two way cameras. I would like to talk our other family members in California into getting one for the benefit of my mother-in-law, who could have excellent \"visits\" by iPad with all of them.Also if you want to stream what is on your ipad directly to your HDTV and projectors, that too is now built in. We don't have such a tv because we like watching directly on the iPad itself with earphones.There is also the ability to not only take your own videos but to edit them online. Plus the ability to locate your ipad if it is lost and to wipe its contents remotely.These above new features are opening up a lot of possibilities for educators as well.  Apple maintains an entire subsection on its website to helping educators use the new features to iPad 2 to best advantage.  Essentially, it wants to enable them to use the iPad 2 to put its content onto a screen immediately in front of their students with the teacher controlling the whole thing with his or her fingers.  Go over to Apple to check this all out as it is incredible.I absolutely love the camera on the iPad 2.  There was no camera on the iPad 1.  Much as I have always loved my iPhone's camera, and much as I complained about who would want to use a camera the size of the iPad 2, I admit I underestimated it.  It is just a fabulous camera and with just pointing and shooting you take pictures that look as if a professional had taken them.I also researched this cover that apple was pushing real hard.  It looks great but i discovered the users were not happy with it.  Turns out they have to clean their screens every time they use it because it leaves three big marks on the glass every time.  They also said it was unstable as a stand and one guy smashed his ipad on the floor as a result, shattering it.  Apple is not very good at these accessory devices.  So we ordered the zoogue ipad 2 case and are very happy with it. We have zoogues on our other two ipads as well and are totally happy with them.

Lleras", "ReviewID": "R3SEXRV40Z31JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad is an invaluable travel companion if you are a frequent travelet.Why do I preffer black vs white? If what you mostly do is watch videos on your iPad you want it with the black bezel because the video will blend with the black bezel and look larger than with the white it becomes kind of a distraction, this is the reason why most TV's in the market have a dark or a black bezel.Portability of this thing is amazing, Its light and its easy to lug around when you are traveling. Also the battery life is exceptional, I'm bad at keeping my devices charged up and I have done a couple of 8 hour trips and my ipad was stil kicking when I landed and a few days after, Im truely surprized.For those of you debating between the 3GAT&T;, 3GVerison or the Wifi version, it depends on where you go to. I had the original 32 wifi only and I was very happy with it I noticed I got Wi-Fi access at a lot of places and I could also use the wifi hot spot on my phone to connect however, in recent travels I have been sent to middle of nowhere america where AT&T; has no 3G coverage and hotels have no wifi (yes they are out there, hotels that still have no wifi) after I returned from my last trip to said location I decided I should get the Verizon iPad simply from the coverage perspective and since the 3G service is not on contract and the Verizon plans have more options I decided that was my choice. Now is this the best option for everyone, no! I think the 3G is just for a small amount of users the vast majority should be fine with a 16GB or a 32GB, if you know your way around the app market place and apps like Air Video Server and tools like DVD Fab and TVersity you dont need that much storage space on your iPad you can simply stream everything. Besides, I have a 32GB and I have 57 videos loaded in that 32GB iPad which if I watch 10-12 on a trip it is an overstatement, I'll watch a few on the plane but the rest, Im streaming from my Media Center at home or from NetFlix. When talking to people in line I was shocked at the number of people looking for the Verizon version when they do not travel, people if you are home most of the time just use your wifi, its cheaper and its faster! Another thing to note is that if you are an international traveller and want 3G the Verizon iPad is NOT Global wireless (so no 3G anywhere outside of the US) however wifi will work just fine.You will see people complain about resolution and such and honestly, I think the resolution is perfect, the iPad is not meant to replace your laptop or your desktop or your TV, if it was why they would have bothered with airplay? If you are expecting to dump your laptop because you got an iPad think again, if you just use your laptop for browsing pages and playing games then you might get away with it however if you expect to do Office on these, think again, until MS gets their act together and decides that IOS is another venue of revenue for them I will still need to carry my laptop around to do word/excel/ppt files. Lack of flash support has not bothered me, yes I wish I could see some pages however, Im not in to the too flashy stuff (no pun intended) I rather get the straight text and keep going my only gripe would be that when Im conected via WiFi I would like to get full pages and not the mobile version however that is not an iPad problem it is a server problem.Overall my score goes as followsComfort and portability A+Battery Life A+App Diversity and usability A+Interface A+Expandibility C (I dont need a USB port or anything like that however it is annoying that if I ever needed and expansion either I have to pay for an adapter or its not available)TV Out Support B+ (simply judging that for HDMI you have to buy the dongle)Cammera Quality C (who needs a cammera in their iPad anyways? Face time sure, rear facing meh)Other thoughts:Get a screen protector, I tried the Invisible Shield for my Gen 1 and hated it, the material removes the slickness of the screen and makes it harder to interact. I like the Splash screen protector, it is like its not there and it does make cleaning a bit easier.Get a case this thing is beautiful but if you would like to maintain its resale value get a case that cover both front or back or separate covers, I think the Vapor case hack is pretty interesting.Investigate tools like DVD Fab Video Converter (excellent for making iPad versions of your DVD's and BD's and it does take care of EVERYTHING for you from conversion to the right format to importing to iTunes) TVersity and Air Video for content streaming.Be realistic on your expectations, I know Apple calls their products magic and their user interface and experience is fenomenal however there are limitations as to what these things can do so try to make an informed purchase that you are happy with instead of rushing and then having something that doesnt meet your expectations.

Over time, many of the popular web sites will move away from using Flash and use a newer technology that DOES work on iPads.-Insert a CD (there is no slot and you don't actually need one)-In fact, there is not much else you can't do with an iPad :THE WIZARDSNo, not the ones' from Oz! Wizards are helpful programs that magically pop up and automatically configure things like the Internet and Email connections for you. The iPad has more Wizards than you can wave a wand at! When you first switch it on and whenever you need to set something up it will automatically present you with a Wizard. Therefore setting things up is as easy as 1-2-3.The iPad is also an iPod!! - Loading music is done in one of two ways.1 - install the free version of iTunes onto your normal PC and follow the Wizards instructions to download your music from the 'iTunes Store' or transfer your music from your favourite CD collection. Then, connect the iPad to your computer using the supplied cable and it will automatically 'Synchronise' your music to the iPad. Yup, you guessed it - using yet another Wizard!2 - iTunes is a built in application (or App) on the iPad itself. Tap this App to search for and download your music directly to the iPad. You could even download a movie or your favourite episode of 24 too!Once the music is on there just tap the iPod App to listen to it. Easy-Peasy!APPSThe iPad extensively uses Apps. Apps are downloaded, using Wi-Fi. This is why you don't need a CD drive. These are the icons that are displayed on the screen.Apps are downloaded from the Internet using yet another App called: \"The App Store\". Tap this icon to search for or see a list of the most popular Apps available, some are paid for and some are free! Tap the 'Install' button next to the one you'd like, follow the Wizards instructions and the App will automatically download and appear as a new icon on the screen.LOADING PICTURESThese can be loaded onto the iPad using iTunes, Email or the 'Camera Connection Kit' - this is a separate adaptor ($30) that plugs into the bottom of the iPad. Just insert the memory card from your camera into the adaptor and it will automatically load the pictures into the built in Photo App.THE PICTURE FRAMEWhen the iPad is locked (by pressing the button on the top-right side) and then back on again, you'll see a little icon in the lower right side corner of the display. Tap this and the Photo App will automatically display your pictures in full screen mode, converting the iPad into a digital Photo frame! It is a great feature. This means that you can leave the ipad on the shelf, literally as part of your rooms decor! You may want to purchase a 'Dock ($30)' to have the iPad tilted and supported at just the right angle.Tip: if you need a reason to justify buying an iPad to your wife - use the Picture Frame one!!PRINTINGPrinting is done wirelessly, however you MUST use one of the wireless printers detailed on the apple.com website. Typically, it will not print to anything other than one of those printers. There is one caveat to this statement, it is possible to print to any wireless printer if you pay for and download a third party App that is available via the App Store - use the search keywords 'wireless printing' to find it.It is also possible to email whatever you'd like to print and pick it up on your normal PC for printing.Finally, I mentioned that you could become a Smarter Person by using an iPad - in fact this is not a joke. There are thousands of educational Apps including ones' for learning Astronomy through to learning how to read and play music and even Apps that will help you learn a new language. The possibilities are literally right at your finger tips!!If you're unsure of which size to buy just buy the largest one you can afford. I have a 32GB version and have only used half of its capacity even with some very large Apps installed.The iPad is many things to many people and the information above is just scratching the surface.\"I hope this review helps you make the right decision and I also hope that I did not use too much confusing jargon.\"Good luck!*** update 12th October 2011 ***Apple have released their new Operating System (iOS 5)Amongst many new and enhanced features there is now the ability to synchronise data across multiple Devices. They call it 'iCloud' - think of iCloud as 'Virtual Filing Cabinet' to store your Documents, Diary and a record of your downloaded media from iTunes. Always accessible as long as there is an internet connection.iCloud also allows the iPad to be used without having to 'Pair' it with a computer. It will now work straight out of the box!", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yes it's cool - but it's more about what you can do with it! Great addition even if you have an iPhone 4.", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R21L29HN1F0GC2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My primary reason to buy an iPad was both work and home use. At work I wanted to stop printing the powerpoint decks and reports to read, and just read them on an iPad in meetings/on the go. For home I was tired of not being able to get to all my magazines and never having them on me when I wanted to read them. I also wanted to watch some TV/movies in bed/around the home so that I did not have to switch on the big living room TV. The iPad 2 has been a perfect solution for all these and more. I'm kicking myself that I went with the lowest 16GB version as I find myself downloading more content and apps everyday! It's not a laptop/desktop replacement either at home or work, but it's a great media consumption device and more.I already used my iPhone 4 constantly due to the multitude of apps and games available for it. Fewer apps are available for iPad but it's still thousands, and I have already downloaded 200+ to try, most of them free.The hardware itself is very slick. Very light so you can hold it in one hand, especially if you use a cover - otherwise it tends to be slippery. But it's not so much about the hardware, which other reviews have detailed anyway. It's all about being able to do what you want to do with a device. With the best technology the device itself should disappear and allow you to create, read, connect - whatever it is you want to do. That's what iPad 2 is doing for me, like a netbook never could. Using it is so intuitive and seamless, that despite having the iPhone 4, I am amazed with how much more I can do to be productive. I regret not buying it sooner!Like the previous devices Apple has created the genius is in the apps available for it. The PressReader apps allows me to read newspapers and magazines from all over the world. I can now read some favorite magazines that were so difficult to get in the print version and newspapers too. Apps like the Flipboard and Zite make magazine content come alive. Favorite magazines like Bloomberg Businessweek and Wired are available free as iPad versions to print subscribers. Also, all news magazines are now featuring interactive content, so I'm reading the news article and looking at static images, and then just as easily click on a video to watch it. The Daily is a good interactive made for newspaper but I'm looking for even better interactive journalism!\"The Civil War\" shows us what history books of future should look like with its interactive content and a daily log of events as they happened 150 years ago. Netflix streams nicely and I can watch the content I want to that bore my family to tears - like documentaries. I also download all my PDF reading materials on it and can read and annotate and highlight. Powerpoints are so easy to read and I can scale the screen to look at the graphs better. iMovie is so simple to use, and I've already created several home movies with music and subtitles. GarageBand is great for novices like me, it has a multitude of instruments that I can play and even has smart versions to create music. With penultimate and UPad I've been trying to completely do away with paper notepads, but that's not the perfect solution yet.With apps like Dropbox and Box you can drop your files into the cloud and access them from your iPad. Chatting over FaceTime or over Webex is simple, although it's entirely dependent on bandwidth. With other apps you can access your remote desktop and use every program on your computer or pull any file. I am using TeamViewer which is free for individuals to log into my home PC from work and check my files or run some programs remotely. It shows you your PC screen on your iPad and you drag your finger to move the mouse cursor and click. It's pretty seamless once you set it up, as simple as opening the app. I opened it one day from work to see my kid watching Youtube and surprised her at dinner when she told me she had been doing home work (ha!).Another made for iPad app I use a lot is the Tivo Remote. When I turn it on it automatically shows the program I'm currently watching on the iPad screen with more details and upcoming episodes. I can use the remote buttons or explore like programs, set my season passes, etc. And when I'm not home I can use it to record programs remotely. Xfinity from Comcast also allows you to schedule and watch your onDemand content. HBO GO is simply a delight, I am thrilled to have all the HBO shows available to me anywhere I go!I have been reading much more since I got iPad 2. Especially blogs, magazines and newspapers. That alone makes it worth it for me. And it's SO much easier to stream content like TED Talks, Lectures from YouTube, movies from Crackle and Netflix. I would have never wanted to sit down with my heavy and hot laptop for such prolonged periods to watch this content. There are some fun games available too, and every day more apps get launched which make me wonder how did I manage without this before!Facetime has been fun too. There are Qik (from Skype) and Tango, and several other apps available that will let you do video chat but since Facetime is integrated with email, you can just click on a contact's name and choose to connect through FaceTime. I can not only check on my kid on video through this feature (all they need is an iPod Touch and wireless) but also connect with friends overseas for free. And I can click their pics while they're on the call with me. Again this feature is dependent on video quality but as a multi-tasking mom it's been great to be able to connect any time in video from work to home. My kid will be listening to music on her iPod Touch and my FaceTime call comes in - and we're off talking face to face. VLC Player has been a great app to watch .avi and other videos. I had slightly lower res version of a TV series in AVI format and the VLC player allowed me to watch it on iPad, I prefer that screen to my HP Pavilion 17 inch which has worse resolution and tends to get too hot in my lap anywayBattery life was a big surprise for me. Mine lasts 10-11 hours on the WiFi model with full usage. That is amazing, I never carry the charger as it goes 2 days without charging. Love it! None of my laptops can compare!The frustrations I experienced with the iPad 2 was its inability to play Flash, which will not come any time soon due to Steve Job's dislike of that technology. However, a genius of an app called iSwifter has found a way to run flash on iPad 2 and I have been using it to watch video on websites that have flash content. However, it's still not as seamless as I would like it to be! The other is a more seamless way to store and organize photos and files. I can do this through apps but why not make this more seamless. If I have to delete photos there should be a select all feature to delete a whole folder.If you're on the fence about buying an iPad 2 go ahead and make the leap, you won't regret it. If you already have an iPad then hold on for iPad 3 as this version gives you some enhancements (faster, improved graphics, thinner, cameras) but nothing that is so extraordinary that you can't wait another few months!", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I PAD 2 Initial Thoughts", "Author": "DGK", "ReviewID": "R63GIOHEGF2ME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I'm in the kitchen, listening to my music library, and typing a review for the I-Pad 2. I have put a little more than 14 hours of research and 6 hours of non-stop use. I'm not gonna waste my time writing the specs for this device because if you are reading this I assume you already know the specifications, if not you can easily access the Apple website and do your own research. This review is aimed more towards the educated consumer. A consumer, who like me, has spent various hours of the night researching and contemplating his or her next moves.First, I want to start off with the word \"tablet\", what is a tablet and who needs it? As an avid P.C. user, I tend to define the device as too short, too little. A underpowered, pre-mature device not ready for this day and age. The truth is, their are more people out there who need a tablet versus a laptop. Having a quad core, overclocked, power hungry P.C. I am like most other users; who tend to have a bias when selecting/comparing  portable products. I have been for some time; looking for a laptop with great battery life, portability and power? I first went out and purchased a Macbook pro for about $1199+ some. After a couple weeks of use I was in love. I could not stop showing it off and playing with it. Then I attempted to play games and yes they were playable! But I found myself running to my P.C. whenever I was gonna get serious and then I found myself using my desktop when editing videos. Yet again, I found myself running to my P.C. when it came to doing anything that involved time and effort... It was at this point that I realized that I never used my laptop for more than a hour. Utilizing a mere 20-40% of its power. I used it for; writing papers, showing off pictures and Internet browsing. So I decided to return it. In search for something that made sense.I never considered a net-book useful or even worthy of my time, even less a tablet. The Motorola Xoom came out and I thought it had potential compared to last years 256MB I-Pad. It offers 1GB of internal memory and 32GB of storage space, all for $599. It not only had the potential, but also the power I craved. Although, its pre-mature operating system was a deterrence. This is the same thing that turned me away from the original IPad. Dispite the fact that I liked the original, if people didn't demand it, the product would die and I would be left with a 500 dollar piece of silicon or waste. I needed something portable and practical. I just felt the tablet was a little more practical, if not more useful too because of its  portability and extended battery life. So I took the plunge and got the Ipad 2.First impressions didn't fall short; it was easy to set up, had a beautiful screen, and gorgeous aesthetics. While Apple boasts about its 60,000 app's, I'll tell you what, it's not enough (way better than android though). While you can download IPhone and ITouch apps; they are simply not the same (a 3.5inch app on a 9inch screen). Face Time also seems to be problem, since it cost money for all your friends who don't have an IPad 2 or new Macbook. Tango or Skype are excellent alternatives, but still only supported in a 3.5 inch window. Despite this, it has some killer apps (e.g gmail, calendar syncing, web browsing and etc). My favorite app is TeamViewer, which gives you remote access to your PC from anywhere. This app is simply amazing. I was able to install some programs to my PC from school! While It doesn't support flash, it plays almost every video stream I've seen from the web. Hey, that's all I needed anyways. So I can't complain, but all you flash gamers might.Now I found this whole \"touch-typing\" thing to be an exasperation. Since I am primarily using this product for note taking, its important I am as accurate as possible. Keys kept skipping and words kept missing. So I upgraded to the Apple-wireless-keyboard.. sigh. It was a well spent 69.00 dollars (cheaper models are available). I am able to control volume, brightness and music. Also makes my tablet feel more like a high end net-book. I want to talk a little bit more about writing. I bought this tablet with the intention of using google docs. Well it works, but you have use the mobile version, which has limited functionality. I tried switching to desktop editing, but it was horrendously slow and unworkable. As a matter of fact I'm writing this with google docs now. As long as you are not using bullet points or etc; you should be fine. I do notice some errors that result from a slow ping, so it's worth trying noting it happens. I could more easily recommend using apple's built in \"note-taker\". Its responsive, practical and free.As far as \"Air-Play\" goes, simply amazing. Kind of a pain to set up though. One really has to go into every setting in I-Tunes and mark share libraries under preferences and account profile. When the set up is complete, you simply log in with your I-pad and use the same mobile user name and you are good to go. Of course you have to keep your computer running the whole time unless you have a dedicated server of some sort. Air-paly grants you access to your music, videos and HD collection. which makes that whole HDMI out thing really convenient. Granted its only 720p, Ive never noticed a huge difference between 720 and 1080p Additionally stream times are relatively quick. Just keep in mind this depends a whole lot on your network. Which bring me to my next issue of storage. I honestly feel the only thing anyone needs on tablet is, pictures and apps. Unless you are going on a long trip; a couple movies. I am content and don't think I would ever need an I-Pad with more storage. As far as 3G goes, will its just that. A three year old bandwidth solution. If you can get a tethering plan instead, I would highly recommend it, as you can also transplant GPS automatically when tethering.All in all I'm really content I took the I-Pad 2 plunge. A dive, I really never saw myself taking or considering. Having an android phone and P.C.; it would seem like honeycomb would have made more sense; considering the attractive specs and all. None the less, the IPad 2 meets my draconian standards for 2011. Making any other device look over weight and under-spec'd. While the consensus of professional reviewers have voted the camera insufficient, I could honestly say it does what I need it to do, which is provide fun and entertainment. The rear HD camera is similar to the one installed on the new macbook pro models (2011 refresh). Other than that, I don't plan on taking high quality photos with the device. I might do future reviews with the camera though. check out my youtube channel for video reviews, just look up oceansidecreations.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ipad 2 Wonderful Tablet When It Works!

I bought it online. I received it 3 1/2 weeks later from china. It was amazing for the first 20 hours. The apps were so unbelievable. I have a touch, and it is so much better. On the second day, it started trying to shut down. The battery was at 80%. I tried shutting it off and could not. I called apple. I bought the extra care plan for 90 dollars so they are going to help me. Right? Wrong. The first representative we talked to had us restore it to the factory settings. It took 1 hour to download the 660 mg file. We then restored it to the factory settings. It started working perfectly. We were so happy. The problem was solved! I watched videos and played with it for hours. I ran the battery down and plugged it in overnight to charge. The next morning the problem was back in spades. It then started doing new things like flashing on and off. I went on the website and asked a specialist to call me again. She put me on hold. She was gone for a little while. When she came back, she said that I needed to mail it back to them to REPAIR it. I said What? I have the apple care plan and was told that you would send me a replacement. I have not even had this thing 2 days. She said that the other representative lied to me, and that she could not lie to me. I have 2 options. I can take it to the Apple Store (nearest one 165 miles away) or I can mail it and have it repaired and they will send the same one back to me. She made me an appointment at the store. I am driving the 165 miles to take it back. The second representative (a supervisor) told me that they would send me a replacement if I gave them a credit card and let them charge another 900 dollars for it. When they received the old one back, they would charge it back to me.I have had a kindle for years. The day I saw it on the Oprah show was the day I fell in love with it. I bought one the same day. The first kindle i received was great except the internet would not work. I called Amazon and they shipped me out a kindle the SAME DAY! I got it a couple of days later and loved it.

They did not want to give me my money back, but we negotiated with them and they ended up putting it back on our credit card with some creative measures. A more timid person would have had to take an apple gift card. This was all they said that they could do at first, but I held my ground.  I might buy this product again at a local Best Buy when they come available. If I decide to do that, I will edit this review.

Better Than a Netbook. Wish It Had Higher Resolution", "Author": "P. Colin McGraw \"AV, Computer & EnviroTech Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R17MLSR9WU45GC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The first iPad really defined the tablet market and while a trickle of competing tablets were released, none of them has matched the critical acclaim of the iPad 2. The consensus of CNET, Engadget and most other tech reviewers is that the Motorola Xoom is the closest competitor, but falls just short of iPad.This latest version of iPad sports a thinner design, front and back camera for casual filming and FaceTime/Skype video calls, a gyroscope, better speaker and, of course, a dual-core processor and 9x faster graphics capabilities. You still get the 10 hour battery life, but it's all wrapped up in a nicer package. That said, it doesn't seem drastically different than the original iPad and it feels like this version is simply an iPad with cameras, and the cameras don't perform especially well.Granted, the increased graphics capabilities do make a noticeable difference in the handful of games that take advantage of the increased speed (\"Infinity Blade\", \"Real Racing 2 HD\"), but most of the apps I use most frequently - e.g. CNN for iPad, Netflix, ABC Player, iTunes Video, iBooks, Pandora, SiriusXM, Apple Remote - don't feel like the user experience changed much beyond the increased volume coming from the speaker.My big disappointments with the iPad 2 are that the cameras aren't great, though that's forgivable since I'd use them mostly for video calling anyway, and that the screen didn't increase in resolution from the first generation iPad! I want my Retina display!However, overlooking the faults of the iPad 2, it's still the best tablet on the market, in my opinion.My kids love the educational apps (\"Monkey Preschool Lunchbox\", \"First Words Animals\", \"Shape Puzzle HD\", \"Talking Larry\", \"Peekaboo Barn\" and \"Garage Band\" are all highly recommended), and I think they've gone a long way in teaching even my mildly autistic daughter memorization and puzzle solving skills!I also love that I can get paid content from apps lie Netflix, (Comcast) Xfinity TV and Hulu+ and even free content like on-demand \"Bachelor\" episodes and other shows from the free \"ABC Player\" app. There's just so much capability available to the device through apps and certainly, the wealth of apps available in the App Store is one of the iPad's biggest strengths vs. competitors!It's also a great device for checking email and casually surfing the web, as long as the site you view doesn't require Flash, which is still unsupported. I used to have a netbook that took 5 minutes to boot, then had an awkwardly small browser window and slow response, but you see nothing but instant-on capability and smooth navigation with iPad. I'd definitely prefer this tablet to a netbook!Also, a couple of other miscellaneous tips for those interested:1. The new magnetic Smart Cover from Apple is a must-try! The automatic wake and sleep on opening/closing the cover is more handy than you might first think, as is the ability to roll the cover into a stand for the iPad! We watched Netflix from bed while my wife nursed our baby recently, and it would have been a pain without the handy stand!2. If you buy an AirPort Express or Apple TV, you can wirelessly stream music (and video in the case of the Apple TV) to a remote set of speakers using AirPlay or the Apple Remote app! It's cool to be able to listen to my iTunes content from my kitchen with the iPad as remote control!3. If you're debating whether to buy the WiFi-only or the WiFi/3G iPad, it's worth noting that by paying for the WiFi hotspot capabilities on an iPhone 4, you can not only get data, but location services for your iPad 2, so you can save a couple hundred dollars on hardware and future-proof your connection speed since you can buy a new phone instead of a new iPad to take advantage of increased network speed.In summary, I highly recommend the iPad 2 if you're in the market for a tablet. Its apps are highly entertaining, portable and easy/quick to launch a play, and it just may change the way you surf the web and check email!

Fantastic!There are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder \"DCIM\".2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.Examples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.Those are really the main details, but here are a few more:When you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.You can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose \"Import\". Or, you can select \"Import All\".The iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).Valid video files need to be in the \".MP4\" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.NOTE: the media files are imported into the \"Photo\" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).AND, you can delete any media files after playing them. That way, you can, for example, load a movie or two into the iPad, watch, then delete to make room for others.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPadLess - Especially For Photos", "Author": "B. Mullins \"Digital Rebel\"", "ReviewID": "R30YM9QE8I36W1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Apple markets this as the ultimate portable computer product, but it has serious shortcomings similar to the iPhone that I wasn't aware of as I don't own one.  If you have no interest in external files or photos, then this may not be important to you.  I waited a month for mine to be delivered, and after a week, I can say I'm keenly disappointed for specific reasons of Apple's own making.You can't transfer ANY file to it, you can only SYNC all files from one designated computer, i.e. tethered.Despite reading enormous reviews & comments about the original, as well as the 2, I never got the impression from anyone that this was the case.  There were a few rumblings about \"file handling\" and workarounds for it [\"everything's going to the cloud anyway\" \"just use dropbox\"] - but nothing that says what an incredible restriction it is for anyone using photos/movies at all.  Their only official solution is that you buy a $40 dongle that then will allow SD card content [no CF cards, which I have]  to be transferred directly.  But the worst part is that even if you were to transfer anything to it, it all gets dumped at the bottom of  \"saved photos\" without any file separation, and no ability to separate or make collections of them after transfer either.Unlike my iPods, you can NEVER transfer any existing file to another, or create a new one.  Only with Sync.  Apparently they want you to work \"with the app\" to do whatever you want to do.  So the only way you could store photos is randomly, unless you want to sync all file/photos from your one mothership computer.  The only semi-solution is to email yourself whatever you want, then download the photos/files...which again will only be dumped in the \"saved photo\" generic file.  You can imagine the limitations with original file sizes.Another key element to me is the lack of any tabbed browsing, whether in Safari or the special Bing app for the iPad [superior to Safari for most things].  So to actually write an email, while constantly switching between single browser pages etc. I'd find ridiculously cumbersome, not to mention that you can't resize ANY windows/apps at all.  You can only resize font/content within a given page.Which brings me to the keyboard, or lack thereof.  I had no idea that the numeric/symbol part of the keyboard is ALWAYS separate from the alpha part, meaning that if you're ever entering alpha/numeric content, i.e. passwords, airline record #'s etc. you have to hit one key to show the number part, hit the number/symbol, then hit another key to reveal the alpha part again, and back and forth endlessly.  In addition, because there's no real tactile feel for the keys, and because the entry points are different for every program [where the browser bar is vs input for youtube etc] you're staring at the keyboard to make sure your fingers are in the right place, then having to look back up and find where it's going, then back down etc., which not only slows the process, but can give you a headache from your neck bobbing up & down, as well as the different light/contrast levels for the keyboard vs the rest of the screen.Yes - I know that you can get a separate bluetooth keyboard, and that would solve some of it - but it also defeats some of the advantage of the form factor if you have to haul the 2 around everywhere you go.This doesn't even address any particular program you may want to work on - just the physical/OS realities of trying to work with it at all.Yes - scrolling through photos is very fast, and can be easily manipulated with your fingers.  Yes there are some very inventive apps out there that take advantage of finger-abilities, but what the finger giveth, it also taketh away when it comes to anything that requires content creation or precision.  I never expected it to do something like Photoshop, but to be this crippled wasn't in the cards either.This should be marketed to generic users not comfortable with computers, and iPhone users who are used to--and don't want anything more than what their iPhone will already do.  The geeks that have championed it should be dismissed for misleading everyone, as they will always find workarounds, and have multiple devices anyway [macbook air/pro/imac etc].  They could just as easily make an Android phone/tablet work for them.The strength of Apple is supposed to be it's user-friendliness, flexibility and support...with their advertising just teasing out a few of the myriad possibilities of the device.  In the iPad's case, I feel they did the opposite:  they oversold it's abilities, touting dual-core ships, 9x better graphics etc., when in fact none of that really matters at the only pace the interface allows.  [I got my mom a refurb original iPad, the first computer she can work - and there's little difference in most app performance]At the direction of my local Genius Bar & Store Manager, I went in search of an app that could help with photo file/transfer, but I queried one of the best reviewed, \"PhotoSync\" to be sure they responded:\"PhotoSync can only transfer photos to the save photos folder. This restriction is made by Apple unfortunately. Third party developers are not allowed to create albums in the camera roll, save photos in other locations than the saved photos folder, or to delete photo from the camera roll.  All these features Apple reserves completely for itself.  We hope that this will change one day in a newer iOS version but at this point it is the only thing we can offer (though we would like to offer more).\"That may be plenty for most others, but it's not for me.  I went back to see if I skipped parts of reviews that mentioned this, and no - i didn't.  Here's from Mossberg from WSJ...who runs down all the drawbacks, including poor-quality cameras etc., then says:\"there are two big omissions, one old and one new. The old one is that, like Apple's prior phones and tablets, the shiny new iPad 2 still won't play Adobe's Flash video in its built-in Web browser. This is a deliberate decision by Apple, and puts its devices at a disadvantage for some users when compared with Android tablets, which can play Flash, or say they will soon, albeit not always well.The other omission has to do with cellular data. The iPad 2 can't use, or be upgraded to use, the new, faster 4G cellular-data networks being rolled out.\"NO mention of any of the aspects that are important to me, and I would think to a substantial number of people...even if we aren't a majority.I want it to be the Next Big Thing - the one that replaces laptops with a smaller, more flexible form factor that's also inspiring to use.I'm just left with the deflated feeling that I've been had, and mostly because of some very dumb and ridiculous failures in their OS that don't have to be that way...just sticking a finger in my eye as a dedicated Mac user.**Update** I got the 11\" Macbook Air and am very happy with it - although it is a lot more computer power than I needed in pure portable terms -  it isn't substantially bigger than the iPad [especially with keyboard] for those of you that can afford it.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wifi problems", "Author": "A.

Two weeks later I'm kind of disappointed.I have had a couple of issues with this device, biggest one being serious issues with wifi connectivity. Apparently this has been a common issue for ipad 2. I found a fix for mine, which is to say its not complete junk, but definitely an inconvenience to go through all the steps again and again to fix it. The other issue is I keep having audio problems...sometimes when muted it cant unmute itself and I have to restart it in order to get my audio working again. The camera picture quality is not great, in fact its useless. The video quality is decent in good lighting, very usable if you can really see yourself taking video with a 10 inch tablet. The device isnt heavy for me, but my older mother found it heavy for her to hold after only using it for 5 minutes, which is why I would also recommend getting the smart cover for it..it can turn into some pretty useful sturdy positions for typing, reading, or watching video.The positives of this device, I was surprised at how great the screen would be. I thought it would scratch easy or be high maintenance...but its been really easy to keep clean with a small microfiber cloth (not included). Apps load fast, graphics are nice, and perfect for netbook replacement as long as you dont do a ton of typing. Its great for social media and web browsing, but i would NOT use this as an ebook reader, your eyes start to hurt after reading for awhile. Get the kindle for that.I think the app store is slightly over hyped, i have found two unique apps that i couldnt have got for an android tablet...but overall the most popular apps seem to be on both devices.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Changed the way we homeschool!", "Author": "Terry \"tcinsatx@yahoodotcom\"", "ReviewID": "REBPBBOXGSJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was given an iPad 2 for Mother's Day this year and it is truly one of the best gifts I've ever received! I have a large family, and every person here uses the iPad on a regular basis. It's been in use for the last 5+ months from morning until night and I am still delighted and amazed with it.I'd never personally owned a tablet before, or an Apple product, but we have multiple computers and all manner of electronic devices in our home and most people would consider me and my family to be techies. Because we have laptops and desktops and netbooks and smart phones, I didn't think that a tablet would particularly add to our level of connectivity or productivity. I was so wrong.Upon opening my iPad2, I was instantly struck by its thinness and its simplicity. There was just the tablet and a charger and a small, welcome pamphlet. I turned it on and it gracefully guided me through setting up my wireless connection. It offered me a tutorial, but I was too excited to bother with that. I was surfing the net within seconds because the interface is so intuitive.By now, there are loads of reviews that go into detail about the cameras and other hardware featured on the iPad2 so rather than bore you, I will focus on some of the real world ways this tablet has changed the way we do things in my home.As a homeschooling mother of a 9 year old, this tablet has made the best things about learning at home even better! The battery life is so good that we keep it with us all over the house. No need to worry about being near a power supply or booting up time or any of that. The iPad 2 is always connected, always ready. There are literally thousands of amazing apps, many of them free, that enrich my child's learning day. He is working on improving his handwriting and using an app that lets him write right on the screen! If he makes a mistake, it prompts him to try again until he gets the hang of it. Math, reading, journaling, science, anatomy, astronomy, geography, music - there's an app for that!Having the iPad2 has meant that whenever my son wonders about something or asks a question about something, we have the answers right in our hands. Remember when you didn't know how to spell a word or a definition in school? Remember how the teacher told you to go look it up? This is like that, only a thousand times better because there is no walk of shame past the whole class to the big dictionary. My son looks up things all day long just because he WANTS to!There are several exceptional music programs that feature an electronic keyboard. My favorite cost a couple of dollars and my boy is now playing music. It translates well, too, because I have a piano and he is able to play tunes he learned on the iPad on our full size piano.Of course, there are games, too. Lots of them. This has been a real boon when we go on road trips. Even though there is no wi-fi in the car, my son has loads of apps to keep him entertained until we reach our destination. No more asking \"are we there yet\"?I have a 15 month old granddaughter who is becoming very iPad saavy, too. It amazed me that even a young toddler quickly grasps the concept of icons and different apps doing different things. She actually knows how to turn it on and choose the correct folder to find the Fruit Ninja app and successfully launch it and play! There are several other games she enjoys, as well as some delightful alphabet games and story book apps. She also enjoys having us take video of her with the iPad and then play it back for her.I generally have it with me in the kitchen at meal times because I can look up a recipe and have it in front of me while cooking. Or I can watch a movie with the Netflix app while baking or preparing more complicated meals. If I didn't have a Kindle already, I would be using the Kindle app to read ebooks, too. Thanksgiving won't be nearly as tedious for me this year because of my iPad.I now take it with me when I travel instead of my laptop because it fits in my purse! I got a bluetooth keyboard to go with it so even when I need to type a lot, it's no problem (although the virtual keyboard is responsive and quicker to type on than you might think). I spent several days at a hospital with a friend and the iPad allowed us both to keep up with email, google for further medical info, and even watch a movie. I've discovered that there is wi-fi almost everywhere! (That's good because I didn't choose the 3G version.) My friend was so impressed that she bought an iPad as soon as she got home!Even though the device is almost fantastically thin and elegant, I would caution you to purchase and use a case all the time with your iPad. The screen is plenty tough but I have read many, many warnings about dropping it on one of it's corners, which results in the screen shattering. A case is good insurance and many of them feature the magnetic on/off, which conserves battery charge while protecting your iPad when you aren't using it.Other nice, but not essential, accessories are a protective screen film, a capacitive-style stylus, and an extra charger/car adapter. If you will be using your iPad as a replacement for a notebook on a regular basis, a wireless, bluetooth keyboard is nice, too. But other than a good case, the iPad2 needs nothing else to be up and running straight out of the box.Highly, highly recommended.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "First time owner, perfect.", "Author": "Jones102", "ReviewID": "R2ZWEC39TBC80T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not previously owning an iPad I did not know what to expect purchasing the iPad 2.

While it does not have flash, I have so far found that to be no big deal anyway. if you absolutely have to have flash for something, look it up on your computer.Typing:Typing on it is not terrible but its not my favorite. I had an iPod touch and was used to typing on a touch screen so that part wasnt a big deal to me. The touchscreen itself is great and is very accurate as to actually registering the button you hit. This review is written on my laptop though because I knew that I wouldnt want to type several paragraphs on the iPad. For chatting on facebook or searching the internet and stuff like that though, it is actually really great.Cameras:Now the cameras are not 100% what I expected them to be. They are decent but are still grainy. Granted I havent taken pictures and then viewed them in normal size yet, so the graininess is just being blown up to iPad size. It might get better if it is shrunken down but so far it seems grainy to me. Really though, its better than not having a camera at all.Apps:Photobooth seems to be the most fun app for showing off the iPad to other people. it was nice that it came with it instead of having to buy it. All of the other apps pretty much work like the iPod touch's apps do, and I love the iPod touch. The email is a lot nice to use now that it is updated.Garageband is great! for $5 its the cheapest and best audio recording software you can get. It was the first thing that I bought and have been playing with it ever since. I like that you can play the instruments right on the iPad and record and edit it all.Safari is a really great and simple browser and it feels really natural to search the web on itiPod is really good too its like having your iTunes library on your computer and being able to go through all of your songs and have it all spread out where you can see it allI bought Legendary Blade II also for a few bucks and it really shows off how great the iPads graphics areScreen:Like I said above the graphics are really really good on it. My old iPod apps have all had to be updated because they are not even close to the quality that the iPad demands to look good. I think that the best way to see how good the graphics are is with books. the quality of writing is better than on my laptop.The touchscreen interface is the best that I have seen on any of the gadgets ive played with. Apple has dominated the touchcreen market and I dont think anyone comes close to them.Smart Cover:I dont know what it will do over the long run but so far it is great! I didnt buy it from amazon so i dont know what the legitimacy of the seller is, but as for the smart cover itself, I love it. the auto on auto off works great and so does the auto align. It looks great on the iPad 2 and it adds practically no thickness whatsoever. I feel like it actually does protect the iPad and it does its job. when it is rolled up and used as a stand it feels sturdy in both positions. I couldnt be more happy with it. clearly it doesnt protect the back from scratches and stuff, but the back is solid aluminum. aside from a few scratches, its not going to hurt it. I dont plan to drop my iPad, but i feel like if i did drop it face down its strong and cushioned enough that it wouldnt destroy my screen either. I would definitely buy it againMemory:I got the 16 gig and it has more than enough for my 600 songs a 125 apps.I would totally recommend this to anyone and if anything changes I will updateThat is all I have but if you found it helpful I would really appreciate you taking a few seconds to hit the helpful button :) Thanks", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it.", "Author": "Andrew D.

I like the customization of android, but in the end it came down to the stability and the vast amount of apps. Before considering buying an iPad I was wondering why people would not shut up about how many apps there are, well now I really do get it. While some of them aren't very useful for me, there are quite a few i would say that are very well designed and extremely useful and just plain entertaining.I really hated the fact that there was no flash, and no true multiple tasking, but after taking a chance on the iPad I realized I really didn't notice the flash too much, however, the lack of true multitasking can be frustrating at times. The iOS definitely needs an update, but for the first time user it will be a pleasurable experience.The quality of the ipad is incredible, and the experience from startup to actually using the device was impressive to say the least. The screen is beautiful and the screen is extremely responsive. Oh, and not to forget, the battery life is unreal at a true ten plus hours of browsing and streaming video and audio.The Internet browsing experience is very nice, I've had no issues at all. The web pages render perfectly and overall is a blast to use ( even without flash).I would whole heartily recommend the iPad 2 to anyone seeking a device that allows you to browse the web, check email, play games, check and pay bills, loves creating anything at all, or just wants to sit on the couch and watch some Netflix. The iPad isn't flawless but at this price it is very fair for what you get. If you are looking to totally replace your laptop, it's possible, but it just depends on what you really use it for.

The Motorola Xoom appeared to be very well built, but a little on the heavy side.When I tried an ipad after sifting through the sea of Android tablets at the local electronics store, I was sold instantly.  The user interface is so smooth and simple compared to Android.  I also knew that Apple products are typically less buggy than Android.  I've had a lot of difficulties with the bugginess of all my Android phones.  I may have been more courageous to try an Android tablet if more of them had support from Cyanogenmod.  As of now, there are only two Android tablets (not great ones) that they officially support.  Android 4.0 is coming soon, and looks promising, but that's yet to be seen.The ipad is so smooth to the touch, and so comfortable in the hands... it's competitors are no match in initial impressions.After having plenty of time to play with it, I have mixed feelings about it.There are some drawbacks.  Every time you download something from itunes (including music, videos, apps, and books) it asks for your password (if you haven't entered it in the last 15 minutes).  It even asks for your password when downloading free items.  I understand that this was a measure to stop children from running up bills on their parents accounts, but I don't have children, and there is no way to disable this feature.In the appstore, there are a lot of free apps, but I feel there are many more for free in the Android market.  I like free apps.  I don't like paying huge costs for hardware, then still having to pay for every little thing I need it to do.  But that appears to be the case here.  I have found some cool stuff for free, though.  It's just riddled with ads.iOS 5.0... I guess that's the big thing right now, but I'm not that excited about it.  My ipad shipped with 4.3 and I could barely tell the difference after the update.  If they were trying to gain Android's strengths with that update, they FAILED.  iOS defnitely does have it's own strengths, though.I am absolutely astonished at the battery life on the ipad.  I can play games all night, while connected to wifi, and occasionally streaming videos... and by some miracle, I still have plenty of battery life left.  My phone (Motorola Droid 3) would not stand for this... it's dead as a doornail before I get to 3 hours of playing games on it.I previously owned a Kindle 3 e-reader, which persuaded me that paper books were still the best way to go.iBooks changed my mind!  NO EXTERNAL LIGHT NEEDED! Unlike the Kindle or Nook.  You can read in the dark without disturbing your bedmate.  It actually looks and acts like an open book, too!  I'm so excited about that.  When you flip the page, you literally touch the edge of the page on the screen and flip it like a book's page!  The screen is very sharp, and brightness is adjustable to levels that are tolerable in the dark or in bright sunlight.  Honestly, it's completely worth being 3 times the cost of a Kindle just as an e-reader.Internet browsing is terrific.  Much better than I ever expected from a mobile device.  All this bickering about iOS not using flash... it must be old news.  I've loaded flash content on both Safari and the Dolphin browser (from the app store).  What's more... flash appears to be smoother on my ipad than on my flash supported Droid 3.Also worth noting, the ipad docks to my car stereo just like my ipod classic does.  The stereo is able to maintain control over it just as it does an ipod (I read mixed reviews about this functionality).  The surprising thing... the stereo also charges the ipad (although, I believe it's at a slower rate).All in all, the ipad is great, but I still feel the pinch of the lack of customization that I've enjoyed with Android.  In physical form, it has no competitor.  I'm happy with my purchase.Cyanogenmod! This is a call for a port!

Although the webcam isn't the best out there, it gets the job done, but if you're looking for a professional resolution, prepared to be dissapointed!  Ipad 2 basically does exactly the same thing as the first generation in terms of features. The only difference is the fact that it's thinner and lighter (HALLELUJAH!).

I loved that movie for all the action and, of course the story, but more for the way that the creators of the film portrayed the future. All of the self driving cars, and gadgets that no one had ever thought of.Anyway, I was watching it the other day and the police chief guy with the bald head and glasses was carrying around something that looked like a book, but it had a screen. It seemed as if the screen was a touch screen, and he was having what appeared to be a video chat with another law enforcement agent on the thing. This was an idea of a gadget that the creators of the story and movie thought they would see in the distant future, like 2020's or 2030's. An awesome portable, touch screen device that had most, if not all the functionality of a PC, but smaller than a book. It's not 2020 something, though, and I realized that I had a much better, sleeker, and if I might say more futuristic looking device that performed as described right next to me. It was the iPad2.Now, I'm no Apple fanboy. Not in the least. I grew up using Windows machines at home, and my only experience with Apple before buying my first ipod touch 4G was in the \"computer lab\" in elementary school. But, last June I picked up the iPod touch 4G like I said, and I was blown away. It was so easy to use. So portable, so fast. I didn't like one thing, though, and it was the fact that the damn screen was too small to really use it for all the things that you could use it for other than just music and videos, like surfing the net, or using any of the million apps available. My hands were just too big.This was a problem. I don't have a lot of money to throw around, and the next step up on the Apple mobile line was the iPad2, and the 32GB version that I wanted was around $600! Thats a lot of money. And I already had an iPod, and at least two other Windows based machines that are very fast and up to date. It just didn't make sense to really buy the thing.I just kept falling more and more in love with the iPod touch, though, and more particularly with iOS and how well it performed. Everything worked and made sense. You wanted music, you hit the music \"button\" on the screen. Email you say? After you set up your account you just press the mail button. Pretty simple. The touch gestures are amazing too. The responsiveness and speed at which the device reacts is amazing. And its so smooth, people. Seriously, if you haven't handled an iOS5(when I got the ipod touch it was iOS4 i think, but the update is awesome) device you owe it to yourself to try it. Its incredible.But, I was still using that super tiny screen, and I couldn't send an email because my fingers would hit like 3 keys at a time and it would take a year to type it all out correctly. Surfing the net, although super fast and smooth, was horrible because typing a web address took a long time. What was I to do? I just gave up on using the iPod for anything other than media, and the occasional youtube video. I still played games on it, but even with the games, I really wanted a bigger, brighter screen.I started to look for reasons to buy the iPad2, and I couldn't come up with any. Not for about two months, at least, until my girlfriend said she needed a laptop and didn't really have any money to buy one. Bingo. I would give her the laptop, and even though she lives with me and I can still use the thing, I'll be down a machine and it leaves an opening for me to replace it. Right? Right!Off to my local retailer(sorry amazon)I go. 30 minutes later(store is literally right down the street from me) and I'm at home, updating the operating system and transferring all of my previous purchases and then I'm up and running. I was blown away.I knew what I was getting, a much bigger version of the iPod touch 4G. And, I got exactly that, and a whole lot more. First, the screen size is a huge plus. Much bigger than the iPod touch of course, and more than big enough to handle any number of tasks or games, or whatever. The keys on the touch screen keyboard are a really good size. No missed keys here people. And my fingers aren't small. The screen is so bright, and it just begs you to touch it. Movies and videos look great, and the web and all the apps are very vivid. This thing just looked great.It was lightweight too, and very thin. Physically this thing is like a very thin composition pad. Actually, much thinner than a composition book. About the same weight, though. Overall, the dimensions and weight make this thing ultra portable.If you're at all familiar with iOS you know about the apps, and they're pretty much all great. There are quite a few that are free as well, so don't let that stop you. In fact, some of the best games and apps available are free, or are just a buck so its not that bad. They range from super useful to super fun. Everything from photo transferring(desktop/laptop to ipad without USB)to remote desktop connection, to Grand Theft Auto is available, and almost anything you can think of has an app. Need a level? You can get one on your ipad for free. Want to tweak a photo? Get photo toaster jr for free and get tweaking. The apps are a real strong point for this device, and they make up for some of short comings of the device(more on that later.The battery last forever. Ten hours is more than enough for me. Plus you get a wall charger and a usb style hook up that you can use to hook up to your car if you have the adapter. Sweet.Like I said, processing speed is very quick, and it handles everything I throw at it all day long with no problems. Videos run without clipping or lag time and apps load up and run perfectly. I never have any freezes or crashes. Awesome.I can't say enough good things about this thing. Really. I can say few bad things as well. I wouldn't say bad, but you know, not what I would want from a \"perfect\" device.First, there are no USB ports. This sucks. There are apps that like I said earlier will help you transfer photos and videos, and documents, but it would be better if you could just plug directly in to the device.Second, you can't charge this thing with your laptop. Or I can't. It has to be plugged into the wall. Not too bad, but it sucks if you need to charge and you have laptop full of juice but no outlet.The biggest problem I have is the price point. Honestly, this thing is worth double what they want for it in my opinion. It will redefine how you look at computing in general. It is so much more intimate. But, even with that said, I think I have the right after purchasing to complain about the price a little. Again, worth every penny, but really pricey and I had to save up for the thing, and that sucks sometimes.Other than that, go buy this thing. Seriously. And shame on you if you think you can get what this thing delivers from a Kindle. Those guys are playing a very bad game of catch up. And they're going to lose. Think Android to compete with the iphone. I've used both. Androids are horrible. Epic fail. Now Amazon wants to lose money trying to compete with a legend. Trust me, if you want mobile, go Apple.

These are not necessarily downsides, just things that are keeping me from using it separately from the computer.It should really be able to update the podcasts I'm subscribed to automatically via wifi - it shouldn't require reconnecting to iTunes.The virtually seamless integration it has with the Apple TV is proof to me that it should be capable of doing these things.The battery life is pretty impressive. The biggest issues I have with its power relate to charging. It comes with a special 10W power adapter which allows you to charge the iPad in a relatively reasonable timeframe, but charging it via the computer's USB port is as easily measured in days as hours.The charger looks exactly like the ones that come with the iPhone and iPod, and it will charge slowly with those, but the iPad's 10W adapter will overcharge the batteries in the iPad's smaller cousins, seriously diminishing their life.

I tried the MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi) and was happy enough until I tried this iPad 2.  I love this updated version!  The only issue I had was trying to decide which version to get since there are many options.Storage capacity can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  I would recommend at least the 32 GB since you cannot expand the storage and although apps do not take up much space, I was amazed at the amount of stuff I loaded onto my iPad (photos, movies, music, documents, etc.).  Trying to save some money, I wondered if I should get wi-fi only or the wi-fi/3G combination and with which service provider, AT&T; or Verizon? Every iPad has wireless technology built in and automatically finds wi-fi networks easily but if you want to use it while traveling, the great outdoors or rural areas, wi-fi is not always an option.  If you have an iPhone 4, you can use it as a personal wi-fi hotspot for your iPad but your iPhone carrier might charge extra when this option is used.  Also, GPS is on the 3G models only, wi-fi provides an approximate location and this could be an issue if you love using Four Square or other GPS based applications.  More importantly, the wi-fi only model cuts your battery time down (~8 hours).  If you do choose wi-fi + 3G, I would check with AT&T; or Verizon networks for pricing before deciding.  Both seem to provide reasonable costs for domestic usage but international usage is outrageous.  The previous iPad allowed any carrier to be used overseas (which is a bargain) but I'm not sure if AT&T; and Verizon models allow for the same thing.This new version is lighter, faster, slimmer and has slightly longer battery life at 10 hours.  I love the brilliant LED backlit display on the 9.7 inch screen.  I'm still not a fan of Pages (iWork) but it is possible to get Word documents on your iPad through iTunes.  There is no official Microsoft version but being able to download Word documents from my pc to the iPad and work on them makes a huge difference for me. I really love the technological improvements that allows this iPad to know your every move and be more responsive.  No matter how you rotate this iPad, the display self adjusts - even if you place it upside down!  It makes playing games like Critter Ball that much more fun to play and allows viewing movies or reading a book in any position.  Need I comment about Apple apps?  They beat the Android and every other market out there on this score and help make Apple products first choice.For me, The only thing that prevents this tablet from being perfect is a better camera and the lack of Mozilla (I know this will never happen).  I have tried a lot of tablets and prefer this one over all others.  Yes, it is expensive but I consider it a good investment since it allows me to complete tasks on-the-go and help pass the time while waiting.

Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.A great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.Being a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3\" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7\" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.The limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called \"Pages\" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and \"GoSkyWatch\", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.The 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.At this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.The price is right and the product is truly outstanding.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "One Word:  Splashtop", "Author": "Mastodan \"Mastodan\"", "ReviewID": "RHCCZCFW5SYMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"This sunlight is OK, I guess, I mean it provides all my food I suppose, but I have to give it zero stars out of 5 because I danced naked outside one day and it totally gave me a sunburn.\"I swear, this is what it sounds like when people complain about new technology.  Is there an astounding amount crammed into a small, considerably weight-reduced package? A resounding yes.  Are there some pretty impressive apps available for it?  Per this review's title, yes.  Is it a completely effective replacement for meaningful human contact?  No, but I'm reserving judgement for when generation 3 arrives with an optional mounting harness for love dolls.Look, its not perfect...realistically, it'll be a solid 4 or 5 years before a device in this price range can match the 160 gigs of an ipod classic with flash memory, and the dual core chip, while fine for day to day maneuvers, can lag in the more intensive tasks (not that there are many apps that convert things to DivX format or remotely control nuclear cooling towers).  Additionally, the lack of slots for SDHC or its 'micro' version knocks off a point or two for versatility.  Once data is on the thing, your only hope of exporting is via email or with third party software (and be REALLY careful to test it out with nothing crucial already installed, as there are some abysmal titles out there).  Also, I feel a decade of that proprietary cable is enough.Gripes aside, this thing is a joy to use.  The battery is every bit as good as people claim, my average use per charge is right between 11 and 12 hours.  No screen protector was included, but aftermarket options are plentiful, and the matte finish option I tried produces an incredibly natural response, especially when using a stylus.  Need to entertain a child 1-3 years of age?  Furry Friend is a fantastic app, and less than 2 dollars in the full version.  Splashtop, though, is the primary component of the 5 stars.  Full version is fairly inexpensive (intermittently goes on sale for 1.99), and it has saved me both time AND monitor life; Splashtop is remote control for your PC or MAC...nothing new there, those in the IT world have been doing this for some time, and its one of the features advertised for Windows 7 in particular.

I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the \"new\" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.You can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.The size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or \"apps\" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.These are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it \"right now\" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.In a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.  Obviously I've been praising the Ipad a lot  and I don't regret my purchase, full marks *****.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Never thought I would actually use one--Now that I have it, I can't live without it", "Author": "Aerfally", "ReviewID": "R3574RJ9KZHVB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great gadget.

I have a couple of laptops and have owned a netbook for a couple of years. I bought the netbook because of its portability, size, and relative light weight when I am on the road.Throwing caution to the wind, I bought this  Ipad2 and it was instant love. Installation was a snap and took a matter of minutes per the instruction card which comes with the device as well as accompanying online prompts. There are a huge number of applications available for the IPad and many of them are free; others are available at minimal cost. The learning curve for using this device is fast; if you own an IPhone it is even faster. The platform this is built on is similar in operation to the IPhone. As for installing new apps, I have yet to encounter any installation problems with my add ons, though some people have.If you install the ereader app, it negates the need for a Kindle or Nook. While I'm not about to toss my Kindle, this is a nice alternative to carting around yet another device when I travel.The battery's charge is supposed to last about 10 hours. That is a fairly accurate measure as I've been averaging about 9 to 10 hours before draining the charge.The device's design is truly a work of art. While this is not a very constructive comment re: to buy or not to buy, I'm driven by aesthetics. I'm drawn to attractiveness and functionality. I own a lot of Apple products and their purchase has partially been driven on visual appeal and cleverness, though ultimately i have fallen in love with their ease of operation and their ability to go way beyond most folks'  imagination. What I am trying to say is that even if you buy this blindly assuming that it will do most of the things your laptop does you'll probably be surprised by its many added features. The  Ipad2 is very light and portable. It is easy to hold and with a smart cover or case that converts to a stand, it works great on a  flat surface or a lap. It can slip easily into a purse. I usually carry a small or medium Ameribag and have no problem getting it to fit. In order to keep this pad in pristine condition and safe, I installed a screen protector, a back cover, and a smart cover. For what it's worth, this pad is nifty but I wouldn't try to see if it will bounce if dropped. Additional accessories are readily available such as Bluetooth keyboards, headsets, and external speakers.The 32 GB capacity is more than adequate for my needs. However, an application junkie may need 64GB. I mention this because my son is upgrading because he wants to add more apps and is running out of space. 16GB or 32GB is probably adequate for most users.Response time is robust on this little sucker. While I didn't buy the 3G model, I haven't had a problem attaching to free WiFi and reception has always been good given that I'm usually in populous areas.The pad's sound quality is good as well as the screen's image. The camera is o.k., but I prefer my IPhone's camera or better yet a high res dedicated camera.While I had no previous experience with IPad's first incarnation, IPad2 seems to be an improvement over the first release due tofaster processing speed and a lighter and more compact design. While there is no slot for an SD card, I suspect that subsequent IPads will feature better and/or more sophisticated cameras and video conferencing capabilities, and an SD card slot among other things.Bottom line: the IPad2 is a fantastic device that is more versatile  than a netbook but lacks some of the functionality of a fully integrated laptop. It's compact size and light weight is a big draw as is its ease of operation and performance.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ipad 2, nothing compares", "Author": "B. brown \"moemoe\"", "ReviewID": "R25RQT0IN6XCBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nothing I can say bad about the Ipad 2.

For various reasons I did not have an original iPad despite wanting one, so this review will focus on the iPad2 and not the differences between the two generations.1.  Screen.  The Screen on the iPad2 is gorgeous.  HD movies really do look HD, and the iPad2 provides a very satisfactory viewing experience.2.  Battery life:  Very good.  Despite moderately heavy \"on the road\" use, I have never managed to run my battery even to 50%.  Others are reporting 11-12 hours and this is consistent with what I am seeing.  Apple did a good job with this battery, and the overall power management of the iPad2.  I have my screen set to auto-dim (where the screen adapts to the lighting in the room) and no doubt this helps.  I have never needed or wanted to fiddle with the screen using this setting.  Ordinary Apple chargers work fine to charge the iPad2 battery.  However, many computer USB ports do not have enough juice to charge the iPad2.  My main Windows computer does not; not even from a powered USB hub.  Many third-party chargers for the iPhone turn out not to work with the iPad2 although all of the Apple ones I have tried do, and some of the after-market ones do.  So far my experience has been that if they sold it in the Apple store, it works.3.  Browsing the web.  The iPad2 is peerless for just plain web browsing, and this is what it excels at.  The virtual keyboard is OK for short email messages or filling in fields on websites.  For more heavy duty typing, there are a number of fine outboard keyboards out there.  I was delighted to find that my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard works splendidly with the iPad2 and for road trips I pack it along.4.  Cameras.  There are two; front and back.  They are exactly what you would expect: OK for quick snapshots, but a lens a fraction of an inch in diameter is not going to take the place of a real camera; we all know that.  They work reasonably well for what they are.  I have not yet tried the various videophone applications so I cannot speak to that.The iPad2 is thin and easy to carry.  The Apple case, which many people buy, is nice to have, but it does not protect the back of the iPad.  There are any number of aftermarket leather or other kinds of cases that provide the iPad2 with more protection.  Most of these will cause the iPad2 to power down when the front flap is closed, just as the Apple cover does.  This is a very nice feature.The iPad2 has infinite professional and personal uses.  I can have it in the courtroom (I am an attorney) and look up cases on-line quickly and snappily using the 3GS, since most courtrooms do not provide counsel with Wi-Fi.  Email, Web access, etc., these things are all becoming a fundamental part of our lives.  I used to use my iPhone for portable Web access, and it was OK for that, but the iPad2 with its larger screen is infinitely better for this.  In my life Web access wherever I go is the main use for the iPad2, and it is a critical use.My main negative on the iPad2 are these: 1.  No dedicated USB2 port.  Why not? 2.  The lack of a USB port makes it very difficult to print anything with the iPad2 and for some reason Apple does not make printing easy, or hardly even possible.  Apple flat-out does not encourage or want its iPad2 users to print off of their iPads.  Whether they are trying to protect their notebook sales or there is some other reason, I do not know.  Eventually I anticipate that competition and pressure from the user base (me!) will force Apple to relent on this.In the 21st century, devices like the iPad2 are destined to become a fundamental part of our personal kit.  The iPad2 is beautifully made, and for most of us very much worth having.  Highly recommended.  RJB.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Save your money.

Apple products are said to be easy to use but they don't live up to the hype. iTunes expects the user to know what to do. There are no clues as to how it should be used. All of that money and they can't even afford tool tips. I've spend an hour trying to figure out how to put a PDF into my iPad and it's like pulling teeth. A simple task made difficult by a bad design. Why can't I just drag and drop the files using Windows explorer like every other hardware product in the world? Why so difficult?Apple had an edge when they were first to market. Now they're relying on the loyal base and offer no advantages. Pay more and do less. Still no USB or SD card slots? It makes every task difficult.Good for browsing the web and checking email but not much more.I had to try it and regret the purchase.Simple tasks could be A LOT easier.------------------------------------------------------------------After wasting another hour of my life I finally figured out how to put PDFs onto this piece of junk. When I first started iTunes there was only one menu available and it was hidden under a graphic in the upper left corner of the app. I \"Added files to library\" from the menu and selected my PDFs. This made them appear in iTunes under Books but it didn't put them on my iPad even after several syncs and prayer.The solution(of course) was to select Show Menu Bar from the first menu to get a second menu (File, Edit, View, ...), then I could select View Side Bar to get a third menu I needed to add my PDFs. The first screen they appeared in was also labeled Books but it is obviously something different. After doing a sync the PDFs didn't appear in the Acrobat Reader where I expected them(why would they?) and I eventually found them in iBooks.The PDFs still won't appear in either of the PDF apps I installed.  Why not? This makes absolutely no sense. Easy? No.I tried using the iPad search feature but it can't find the PDFs that are on the iPad even though they show up in iBooks. The files are there. Why doesn't search find them? Because iPads are over priced JUNK! Basic functionality doesn't work.Apple products are supposed to be easy to use but they are far from it.Very disappointed.  Not designed well and lots of room for improvement. It makes me wonder what they've been working on for the last few years. It wasn't usability.------------------------------------------------------------------The more i use it, the more I hate it.

Not to be outdone, I bought an iPad as well.  Now I thought I'd be using my iPad more than my Android, but this has turned out not to be the case.  You see,  Android and iPad are two very different devices, with one device often doing things much better than the other one.  So I've found myself using each device for different purposes, and I've found my Android device to be much more practical for everyday use.Here's a summary of my findings over two weeks of using both devices:OS Stability:  The winner here is the iPad.  I've experienced occasional freezes on the Android tablet, along with delays and slowdowns.  The only delay I've experienced on the iPad is when I'm using Safari and want to type in an address in the address bar.  There is a small delay from when I type the 'www' to when it shows up on the screen.  No big deal.Camera:  iPad is far and away the winning choice here, especially since my Android device came with a shabby VGA camera.  I can't speak for other devices like Galaxy Tab, but the iPad with its front and rear facing cameras definitely wins.Video Chat:  iPad.  Especially since my Android tablet doesn't, as yet, support this.Screen Resolution:  iPad.  What can I say about this, other than the difference is like night and day.  The Viziotab's screen resolution is, in a word, ugly.  It seems very one-dimensional compared to the iPad's.  The iPad screen is clear, bright, and attractive.Browsing:  I'm going to give this one to Android.  Although iPad's browsing is fast and Safari is easy to use, Android has flash.  Yes, I know, the resource hogging flash!  But here's the thing about flash for me: There are a couple of mission-critical websites I use constantly  one is for my job) that use flash.  With the iPad, it's a no go -- unless you buy a third-party browser that supports flash.  So Android wins here.Photos:  This is a toss up.  While iPad blows away Viziotab in terms of resolution, Android wins simply because you don't need to go through iTunes to sync your photo library.  I think I'll be using my iPad to share those photos from my recent trip to Hawaii, but if I need to 'manage' my photos I'll use my Android tablet.Video:  Again, a toss up.  iPad presents videos beautifully, but management is a pain in the a**.  First, iPad doesn't support all video formats.  And second, you have to sync your videos through iTunes.  So, if I have that iPad-compatible video of my trip to Egypt, I'll share it on iPad -- otherwise I'll be using my Android tablet to manage my video collection.Email: I was at first impressed by the iPad email app.  But I enjoy reading my email on Android.  Perhaps it's the Android's integrated GMail app, which makes viewing email a more pleasant experience.  iPad just seems awkward.  Android wins here.Downloading:  No contest here.  Android wins.  You can download anything to an Android tablet, including video and audio in multiple formats.  Android supports torrent downloading, too.  What can you download to iPad?  iTunes apps, music, and video, all of which come at a price.Games:  iPad wins.  I just can't see Android competing in this area.  Although I'm not a big mobile-device gamer, so it doesn't really matter to me.Bluetooth connectivity:  iPad supports Apple devices.  Android supports everyone's devices.  Android wins.Apps:  A toss up.  App store wins for number of apps, and for integration with iPad.  Market wins for functionality.  I like ebooks, for example, and have ebooks with Barnes and Noble and Kindle.  But Apple has hamstrung the Nook and Kindle apps buy taking away the ability to download books through the iPad apps.  And there will be no app available through the app store that duplicates any other functionality that would eat iinto Apple's profits.Viewing Videos on your HDTV:  With the purchase of a $5 HDTV cable I can view beautiful, high resolution movies and TV shows on my HDTV with my Viziotab.  With iPad you have to buy Apple TV ($99) and then are limited to iTunes store purchases.  Viziotab is the winner here.In conclusion, I like the iPad for its big, beautiful display and ease of use.  I don't like it for its limitations, like lack of bluetooth connectivity, file management capability, and file format support.  I will keep my iPad to share videos and photos of vacations, and to use if I have to video conference with someone.  Which will probably be never, but at least it's there!  And for the cool apps that I do like.  Not so much for browsing or file management.  If I were to have to choose between the two, I would choose Android simply because it is wide open compared to iPad. If I sit on the couch to surf, I'll use Android because I know there will be no artificial barrier between me and the world wide web.  And if I go on vacation, I will take the Android with me for compatibility reasons.Buying advice: If you're an Apple user already and are immersed in the Apple ecosystem of products and services, compatibility probably is not an issue for you, so I would choose iPad.  If, however, you're not an Apple user I would carefully weigh the compatibility issues.  The iPad effect wears off eventually, and you have to realize the iPad is a device that does some things really well, other things not so well, and a few things not at all.  If those things it does 'not at all' are things you need it to do, then you might be well advised to get one of the Android tablets to better serve your needs.  Or, if you're like me and can afford it, why not get both?", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet on the market for now... I'm looking at you google", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "R1WA14IGR0EPJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The iPad 2 has got to be one the best things I have ever owned. In the start I thought I never \"needed\" just wanted it. But now I cant see myself not living without one. I hardly use my 17inch desktop replacement now. I only use it for certain tasks like downloading files, converting files, heavy typing tasks and pc gaming. I also hardly use my HTC Deire Android smartphone or iPod touch 3rg gen for surfing or apps any more when Im home. After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I havent noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.December 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but dont work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.April 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.The iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "A warning about where to purchase an ipad 3G", "Author": "Denny", "ReviewID": "R3B4UDIYMEUZLR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you buy from Apple, the 3G is either $15 or $25 per month as the SIM is included, but if you buy the ipad with 3G from anyone else, you must go get the microSIM card from either ATT or Verizon depending on what model ipad you purchased.

I paid full price for my 64gb iPad and I don't regret it, even as long as it took me to save up for it.  I love getting digital copies of movies (like from the bluray discs you were already going to buy) and putting them on this bad boy to take wherever I want.  Not only can I enjoy it, but with an AV adapter cord I can plug it up to any HDTV and entertain everyone.Obviously the apps are awesome.  There practically is an app for everything.  My biggest consideration in getting the iPad over an ereader was the amount of books you have access to.  On an iPad, you have access to all the iBooks, Kobo books, B&N; nook books, and amazon kindle books through their own app.  Just recently I found one negative thing about having an iPad over a kindle.  I'm not talking about the fire either, because I really don't know enough about the fire to compare point for point, I'm just talking ebooks here.  The Kindle lets you borrow one book a month I believe it is for free (the kindle version ones that are listed as $0.00) if you are an amazon prime member.  Until recently, I wasn't a prime member and I wasn't disappointed until I found out that the iPad app for kindle doesn't offer the free borrowing of books unless you have an actual kindle. This may change some day if enough people complain, but as of right now, it isn't offered.  So if you are fine with paying for all of your books or you aren't willing to pay to be a prime member, then you have access to more books on an ipad.  Oh another cool thing is that you can download the overdrive app which you can rent digital books or audiobooks from your local library with your library card for free.  I love the audiobooks because I'm sure you know how expensive they are to buy, and unless I know for sure its a good book, I'm not willing to drop $20-$45 on an audiobook.As for the internet on the iPad, browsing is a breeze, saving pages and bookmarking is a breeze.  The only thing is it does have some problems connecting to little mom and pop wif signals for some reason.  Its a known problem and I imagine the iPad3 will be better at this.  Other than that there are no complaints from me for the internet.Printing from the iPad is so cool, too.  Even if you don't have an airprint printer, you can still find an app to print to almost any printer through wifi.  I haven't found one yet that I couldn't print on using Print Bureau.  Its really cool and after you figure out how to use it, its pretty simple too.  I can even print to my huge commercial printer/scanner/network fax machine at work.I also love the adapters for cameras that lets you easily plug and transfer pictures/video directly to the iPad to send or post somewhere online.If you have an iPod or iPhone, the charger that comes with the iPad is much stronger, and charges your other apple idevices much faster than with the chargers that came with them.Overall very happy with my purchase!!!I wanted to add an update, my schoolwork is online and I did find a way around the adobe flash problem so that I can access all of my school assignments and take tests from my iPad.

I agree with most of the reviews stating \"If you own the first one, you can skip the 2nd\".  The iPad 2 is faster but the iPad 1 is still pretty darn fast.  The only only reason why I bought the iPad 2 was for the front facing camera which is pretty cool.For the gamers I downloaded Deadspace, which is designed to take advantage of the iPad 2's enhanced graphics.  I have to say it's a good looking game and should start to scare Microsoft and Playstation since Apple is starting to further encroach on the gaming market.  I wouldnt be surprised if the next gen iPad is up there with ps3 and xbox 360.  The only thing really holding the iPad back gaming wise is the lack of a bluetooth controller, I hate using the screen as a controller!If you don't own an iPad I definitely recommend you buy one, it's pretty amazing :P.

I recommend this to anyone new to an iPad. Recharges now take less time than before. I paid $214.99, including shipping, for this unit and feel like I saved 50% over a new unit. I surf the web, do emails, read my Kindle books on it and am now searching the available Apple apps.I feel really great about this purchase and the unit.

One hint on the data: If you can find a decent mifi data plan then you can just get the wifi version of the iPad and be done with it. Even so, I find wifi hotspots all over the place (including my house of course, which is where I use it a lot).The camera is ok, but I use my iPhone for pics, so I really don't care. They could have substituted the camera for some other feature and I would have been just as happy.It is an awesome game platform as it gives you more space to play with. It also works great with the Apple TV and streaming audio.Yes, Android tablets are catching up, but they still aren't there yet. They don't have the price point of an iPad nor the consistency of the user experience.The iPad is also a durable product: I have dropped mine, and only had small cracks appear on the bezel, with no affect on performance whatsoever.

I was a little disappointed with it at first, since it wasn't \"magic\" and didn't really live up to the hype. But I used it for reading books and watching movies, and slowly found myself using it for more and more things, until eventually it replaced my laptop (which, with my netbook, now sits collecting dust most of the time). Between my iPad and my desktop computer, they cover just about everything I need or want a computer for. As a result, I can't see myself buying another laptop, ever.

Apple replaces the battery and metal shell--the parts most likely to be damaged or worn out--when they refurbish iPads.  I honestly can't tell that mine is a refurb.

I have researched for quite a long time before I bought my Prime (since returned) and actually had THREE Android tablets that all just did not cut it for me.  If you are on a lower budget, than certainly there are MANY Android tablets out there.  If you have the funds, I highly recommend the Apple iPad 2 as it is about the the best \"overall\" tablet out there.  Whether you like Apple or Steve Jobs history or politics, the iPad 2 really is a quality machine.  Nothing is perfect, and nothing will please everybody, but in comparing devices, I now have the experience with both platforms and will pick iPad as the best of the two.  For the average user, that being the non-technical, non-programmer type, and the person NOT looking for a tablet to replace a PC or laptop, the iPad 2 is a wonder.  Yes, it sure has different operating system and is \"closed\" compared to Android.  Yes, it does not support Java or Flash, but these are small issues. If you MUST have Java or Flash, or \"hate\" Apple, then no matter what anybody says, you will not like any reviews of the iPad 2.  If you are a regular \"Joe\" or \"Janet\", then read carefully all of the reviews and see that the iPad is a great unit if you can afford the extra dollars.  In a few weeks, the iPad 3 is likely announced and the prices for the remaining iPad 2's will likely decreases.  When that happens grab one immediately.  Of course, if you have the money, might want to consider the iPad 3.  People seem to get personal about an Apple product, either love them or hate them.  I have no bias, I own an Android Phone and will likely keep it.  I own an Ipod Touch and will probably keep it.  Since I have an Ipod and have had one for years (since they came out) I am familiar with iTunes and the iTunes Store.  If you are one of these people, you will find the interface of the iPad 2 familiar to you. Almost every application I used on the iPad 2 (my wifes) as compared to the Android devices was better.  Yahoo and SKYPE Video chat was far superior.  I did not use the camera on the iPad 2, but then again, a camera on a tablet is of NO importance to me.  Ease of use and quality are, and I choose (now) the iPad 2.  I simply like the Apple OS on a tablet better than Android. A huge difference I found with the iPad 2 over Android, is that with the default Android Sync program, I could not SEND an email from my exchange.  I could RECEIVE only.  After finding this out, and searching online, it is common issue and you need to download a third party SYNC program to accomplish this.  The iPad 2 works flawlessly out of the box sending and receiving exchange emails. I almost bought an iPad 2 in the beginning, and after three different Android units, am certainly going to purchase the iPad (2 or 3).  Things might just work out better anyway now, that a new iPad will be announced shortly.*****update: I did purchase an iPad 2 on March 7 after the price was lowered by $100. I can safely state again that this is a fabulous device and I highly recommend.

The lack of Flash is really a problem because there are still many sites that use Flash technology.

It's on.  No wait time, no boot up time.iPad vs Kindle.Initially I bought the iPad as an e-reader because the experience is much superior when compared to the Kindle.  The touch screen is much more book like, turning pages with your finger is much more intuitive than pushing a button.  The scrubber at the bottom of the page so you can slide to any page, where as the Kindle you have to push a button or use the \"go to\" function and type in the desired page.  iPad lets you know what page and chapter name you're on rather than just a percent, the Kindle gives no chapter name or page number.

When ever you want access the internet in remote areas via 3G, just go the \"settings\", cellular data and log in and turn on that option.  So for the next 30 days at $15 you have internet access.The GPS chip is included with the 3G.  There are GPS apps for free, Waze and Motion X GPS Drive for purchase.  With the 3G option you need to turn on the Cellular Data in order for the GPS to work.Waze app is free and is pretty accurate but it did give me incorrect directions but it can only get better since the information is user generated.  Just driving around with Waze turned on generates information for other drivers.  It has voice guidance but does not give specific street names.  It is good in showing road conditions, traffic, hazards, etc....Motion X Drive app is 99 cents and just as good or better than Garmin.  It has many options and gives two different female voices for guidance, nothing really sexy.  It also states the street names but must be purchased for either $3 for 30 days or $20 for one year.  It also gives road conditions but Waze probably does a better job.***********************FaceTimeThe Jetsons technology is here.

I find the ipad too heavy to hold when reading. Perhaps that can't be helped. It certainly is not heavy in the real sense of the word. It's easy to carry with you anywhere. But to hold it upright for long periods like you do the Kindle is not what it was made for. So, I read my books on the Kindle.That aside, I used to think the iPad was an expensive toy. I was wrong. I use it for my business and investments and have yet to play a game on it. I get streaming quotes and financial news and instant updates. Apple has so many apps that you'll find exactly what you want. I have lots of fitness and exercise apps that help me keep my health in check.Lots of people have written in-depth reviews on the iPad and I'm not going to try and do the same thing. I merely want to say that this is a powerful device that can put power in your hands and add a lot to your business and personal life.Apple support is decent but you can't get refunds for apps you don't like or that don't work for you. That's a major con and very much unlike Amazon. Also, Apple's site --- iTunes --- is hard to navigate. But those are the only cons I've found thus far.A word of advice: While 16gb is a considerable amount of space for books, etc, you may regret not getting more memory. I do. Just the apps alone (if you buy a lot of them as I did and most people do) take up lots of space. And video uses lots of memory. I didn't think I'd keep many videos on my iPad but I do. I'm now using about three-forths of my memory and I've only had the device about a month or less. I can assure you that next time I'll spend a bit more and buy more memory and you might want to consider that as well.Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

My husband had just purchased a computer for me as a birthday gift coincidentally, and it had a hard drive failure the 3rd time it booted up.  So we returned it and bought a second iPad 2 for me.  We are completely addicted.  They are so user friendly, work well, and are instant on and off (instead of waiting forever to boot up and shut down like a computer).  We both absolutely love them.You iPad may not have the latest operating system on it since many have been sitting in stores waiting to be sold.  If it has 4.3.5 or older, then you simply can take it to a Verizon store and have them activate it at no charge.  They are an official Apple Store.If you need to update your iPad 2 to the new IOS 5 that is to be released in October 2011, then I have some tips, to possibly prevent a lot of grief. HOWEVER, you can just skip all the rest of the technical part of my review if you pay a small fee to have operating system IOS 5 downloaded onto your new iPad 2 so that it is completely independent of a regular computer and iTunes. This is a huge step that Apple has been developing for awhile now.  I don't know if Verizon will do it for free, but Best Buy will do it for $29.95.  If you go to Verizon, make sure the employee is quite familiar with activating the iPad, etc.  Our local Verizon person acted like she knew, but when I brought it home, it wasn't activated.  That's why I had to go through all this stuff so I could do it on my own computer.The current operating system as of today requires hook up to a computer that has iTunes on it.  The new \"IOS 5\" is due to come out in the next 10-15 days, between October 10-15, 2011.  Anyone who buys an iPad 2 that already has IOS 5 loaded and, also, anyone who already owns an ipad 2 who updates to this version; will be able to do everything without being dependent upon a computer and iTunes.  Right now, you upload photos, your own music, and download and install updates via your computer using iTunes on a regular computer. You can load these things by emailing to your iPad from your computer where they are stored, but if you have a lot, it is easier to transfer via iTunes on your computer.My review is long and some is very technical.  You can stop here if I've already given you helpful info you wanted to know.  The very next section is about some apps I recommend and then after that is the very technical part that isn't necessary if you don't have a computer or want to take my suggestion and pay to have IOS 5 installed on your iPad.------Before I get on with the heavy-duty technical part that you may or may not want read, let me recommend a few apps that you can purchased inexpensively.  Part of the fun is customizing your iPad with apps that you enjoy or help you with your tasks:1. A free app for the iPad is \"Goodreader.\"  This is a great app.  You can view about any format of a file in this app, even Excel files.  You can also make annotations with various symbols and highlighting that the program offers.  You can also unzip a zip file in Goodreader.  I've never done it, but you can watch a video in that app as well.  It has a great folder and file management system that is easy.  I believe you can even bring in files to your iPad from your computer via wi-fi or ftp.  You can also save a web page for reading off line when you are not near wi-fi, such as on an airplane.  I really like this program.2.  If you like to use Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, you can get these apps, but they are $20 each.  I have two excel spreadsheets that I like to keep up on a daily or weekly basis.  One, for example, are our household expenditures and deposits.  Since Goodreader doesn't let you actually add to a Word document or Excel file, I found a program called \"Office 2 HD.\"  This one is not free.  It is a $6.99 program plus fee and tax, but that is less than you pay for either Word or Excel.  It's pretty easy.  What I did was email to myself my Excel file from my computer.  I opened the email in iPad 2 and clicked on the attached file.  Then I tapped on the little curved arrow that you would tap if you want to reply to or forward an email and it gave me the option of opening the file in either Goodreader or Office 2 HD.  I selected Office 2 HD.  Then I opened that app, opened that file, and tapped the Save button.  The Save button gives you a choice of Save or Save As.  When you want to be able to type in the file, you choose Save As and rename it.  If you don't want to rename the file, than add a \"1\" to the file name on your computer before you email it to yourself on iPad; and then when you Save As, just delete the 1.  Easy.  Of course, it works differently inserting rows, etc., than a regular spreadsheet of Excel program, so you really do need to refer to their help menu.  I like the program though, because it is inexpensive and lets me keep up edit my favorite already existing spreadsheets.  You can create new ones also, of course.  I haven't used the word processor yet, but it is probably even easier than a spreadsheet.  Oh, it has a Power Point type program in it also.3.  Right now the default Safari brower on the iPad isn't very good.  I'm very spoiled to using tabs so I can open search listings in a new tab without losing my search page or use the tabs to go back and forth comparing info on two or three different web pages.  The new IOS 5 is giving Safari tabs.  However, I really like \"Web Perfect Browser\" which is only $3.99 plus fee and tax.  Not only does it provide a tab system for browsing, but will also save web pages for offline reading.  I save a web page in the Browser if it is something I want to read later, but not necessarily save.  I save a web page in Goodreader, if I want to keep it for reference.  I don't know all the changes they are going to make in Safari.  You might go ahead and check it all out before buying Web Perfect Browser in case it is good enough for your purposes.4.  A great picture organizer program is \"Photo Mgr Pro.\"  Once again, the new IOS 5 is making big improvements on the default photo.  Perhaps you won't even need this app.  The current default Photo app is terrible.  You cannot put them in the order you want.  As far as I know, the only way to create Albums (folders) is to arrange the folders you want in a special iPad folder on your computer first and then upload the special folder and its contents to the iPad through iTunes.  You still can't arrange the order, however.  I know they have made improvements in the new operating system; but if you don't like it, try the Photo Mgr Pro.  It's good.By the way, the final price of an app varies because some are Apple apps and some are 3rd-Party developers.  The developers do get a fee from each purchase.  All apps have tax added.  I'm not sure how this works, but I do notice that the difference between the app purchase price and the final price is not always the same percentage.  However, apps are so reasonably priced, it just isn't that important.  Just know that when it says $3.99, it actually will be a little more.---------THE TECHNICAL PART OF MY REVIEW REGARDING PROBLEMS UPDATING OR INSTALLING ITUNES:It isn't a big deal using your computer and iTunes (if you have a computer) unless you have the following problems that I ran into.  Here are a couple of solutions below.DON'T LET MY INSTRUCTIONS SCARE YOU.  REMEMBER, you can just have IOS 5 put on it after its released, and you don't have to deal with any of this. By the way, if you don't have a computer, you can take the iPad to a Verizon store to activate it. They don't charge for it since they are contracted by Apple. Best Buy may also do it for a small fee when you don't buy it there.  Best Buy will also download and install updates for you for $29.95, so wait until the new IOS 5.0 is released and have them put that one on it.  That eliminates the computer and iTunes problem since you will be able update and download from the iPad. (I'm repeating, but knowing how to do this with ease and avoiding the problems is valuable to know.)Now back to the iTunes problem.  NOTE:  My instructions are for a PC with XP. It is possible you won't be able to install the latest version of iTunes.  You need a version later than the 9.0 and above series.  It must start with a 10.0 or later for it to be connected to your ipad.  I use version 10.4.1.  I discovered that since I apparently had some previous version of iTunes and/or Quick Time on my computer, it left behind some kind of language.  Therefore, after I downloaded itunes version 10.4.1 and attempted to install it; it appeared to install, but wouldn't open.  An error message appeared saying there were missing files.  After spending 3 days researching off and on for the solution and trying to reinstall etc., I finally found a document on the Internet stating exactly what to remove and how to do it. INSTRUCTIONS: From the PC via Add and Remove Programs in the Control Panel remove iTunes.  Then you remove Apple Application Support.  You don't have to uninstall Quick Time.  Then you close and reboot.  Don't open any programs, but do shutdown firewall and anti-virus programs and turn off your DSL/broadband.  Now you can go to your iTunes install file you saved and install it. Now it will work, or it may say something about Mobile Device Service not started. If so, open Control Panel again and open Administrative Tools.  Open the \"Services\" folder. Click ONCE on Apple Mobile Device folder.  To the left of the file, it says \"Stop the Service\" and \"Start the Service.\"  Click on \"Stop the Service\" and then click on \"Start the Service.\"  I can't remember if you reboot again, but it will tell you. After this, iTunes, should work just fine unless some other cause is creating your problem.NEXT PROBLEM that many people are having is that iTunes will perform all the functions for your iPad except it won't download an OS (Operating System) Update.  It will act like it's downloading, but eventually times out.  I have a solution, but you can confirm that your problem is the same as mine by doing the following:  Open iTunes and click on Help on the menu.  Select \"Run Diagnostics\".  Uncheck everything except the first line to do a Connectivity Test. Make sure your DSL or wi-fi is connected. Click Next. Click Next again and it will list test results.  The first two lines will have green dots, meaning ok.  The third line will be red, \"Secure Link to iTunes Store Failed.\"  What is peculiar about this is that I can purchase an app through the store, but can't download an update.  The problem is somewhere in conflicting language or programs.  After 3 more days of trying to fix, it I finally found a webpage that lists direct links to Apple and instructions.  You choose your particular kind of iPad; for example, iPad 2 wi-fi only.  Then you download the file and save it to a folder where you won't forget where it is.  Be aware that is is a 690 MG file!  It takes hours to download.  I have DSL \"light\" which means it is slower than regular hi-speed, so it took my file 8 hours to download. Make sure your Power settings say never so the computer won't sleep during the download.  It's ok if your monitor sleeps or the desk top activates a screen saver. By the way, I also was not able to download it on my computer than has iTunes.  I had to use my very old computer that has never had iTunes on it.  My itunes computer blocked downloads even directly from Apple!  If you don't have another computer, use someone else's computer that doesn't have iTunes. OR just wait for IOS 5 (release in Oct. 2011) and pay Best Buy $29.95 to download it and install! After downloading it, I put it on a flash drive and transferred it to my other computer that has iTunes.  Next, plug in iPad to your computer via the cable included; do this BEFORE opening iTunes.  If you haven't already activated your new iPad 2, then you will be activating it now through iTunes.  Once it is activated, you are ready to install the update you downloaded, which will IOS 5 after it released. iTunes may pop up a window that asks if you want to download the update.  Press Cancel.  If it is set up to automatically download it, press the X next to the field at the top where it is showing that is is downloading.  That will stop it.  NOW, since your iTunes will not work for downloading if you have the same connectivity issue that I do, you will HOLD DOWN your shift key WHILE you press the UPDATE button.  You will only see the UPDATE button if you plugged in your ipad first to your computer and then open iTunes.  A menu just for your iPad will appear across the middle of the screen and the Update button is on the Summary tab.  After you hold down the shift key while clicking on Update, it will pop up a screen allowing you to find your downloaded file.  If you computer downloaded it as a ZIP file, you'll have to unzip it first and then choose the file.  iTunes will now update your iPad with the new update.  It takes about 10 min or less.  By the way, I have Opera browser on my old computer and discovered that it doesn't force a zip file as some browsers do.  It will download the file as it actually comes with the correct file extension.Hope this review doesn't scare you off.  Remember!  You don't have to deal with any of these problems if you pay a store that is set up for iPads to download the new IOS 5 operating system which makes iPad completely independent of a separate computer and iTunes.  Again, I don't know what Verizon would charge, but $29.95 is pretty good at Best Buy.  Call first to make sure the stores near you will do it.Have fun with Ipad 2.  It's great!  I'm quite advanced on PC's as I used them for the last 15 years for my jobs.

But here's why:1) It was too heavy for me to rest comfortably on lap while lying down.2) I had to purchase GoodReader to see if that would work for the main reason I wanted an ipad2 (to dowload and read academic pdfs from a certain website and zip files from another speciality website). I should have done this to see if it was compatable, but by the time I figured this out I had already invested so much time getting this to work right and had had enuf.3) Similarly, i would have to purchase a stylus to see if I could find one that worked for me. I'm used to using wrist movments and finger movements to work for long periods of time - not upper arm movements - so I would have to use a stylus. was not prepared cause I thought my styluses I already have would work on the IPAD4) Worst onscreen keyboard I have ever used. You have to hit a seperate key to make numbers and symbols like @ appear, and then hit the key again to return to letters. Perhaps i'd get used to this, perhaps not. so for, not.5) Similarly, if you can't touch type with the keyboard (you can't, I tried) then why space them out so far from one another? or why not let it be modifyable depending on the needs of the user?6) in the app store the print is too tiny. Much to my surprise, I could not expand it in the usual way. I did not bother to see if there was another way to expand it7) there's something dizzying about the way it switches between screens.8) Apple's official position is that they will not support WIFI conncections that use the older WEP security. Their only advice is to upgrade to WPA which they are happy to help you with excpet they don't care about the problem that then my older two devices would not be able to connect...So if have intermittant trouple with wifi because of WEP, don't count on Apples help. It took me ages to access some firmware to upgrade, only to find that i can't use WPA.9)In the store, the Ipad I tried got so dim as to be practically black. that's what I want for the dim lighting i use it in. My unit does not get as dim as that one. It's probably ok though.10) The final straw was an irrational one I guess...I decided to take a break from figuring things out and watch some stuff from NBC. I had not realized NBC does not support IPAD. the shows are on hulu but why shyould I pay 8 bucks a month when I can watch for free on my laptop. Other people have commented that they are going to start watching more ABC. I would rather find a table that lets me watch what I want.11)and ok, one more, i would also like to upload files to a speciality website, but didn't check to see if there's an app for that...12) I hate all the going thru ITUNES, a behmoth that now sits on my laptop, though i'd probably get used to this.Overall, Apple is really great at creating problems and then offering to sell you an App for that (no usb, no Word, no excel, can't upload or download files etc.).

When iPad 2 came out, I thought it was a nice evolutionary step, but not enough for me to upgrade.However, the seemingly small changes do turn out to make a difference.  For example, one of my favorite uses of the original iPad was to read various newspapers and blogs while having breakfast. That worked pretty well, but the limited memory of the original iPad caused web-pages to rarely be cached: Following a link and then hitting the \"back\" button felt a bit sluggish. With iPad 2, this scenario works a lot better. Similarly, FaceTime and video Skype support were attractive to me, but I figured that having an iPhone 4 already would largely mitigate the advantage of having the feature also on iPad.  Well, the larger size of iPad 2 makes it much more natural to have my daughter join alongside of me in a conversation with overseas family members. The small weight and dimension differences also have a disproportional effect. My kids use a drawing app that also seems to benefit from the added hardware capabilities (memory-bound, I think) and GarageBand is even more impressive on iPad 2 than its already remarkable power on my original iPad.I had a chance to try some other tablets (Xoom, 7\" Samsung, and Nook color), but at this time they're far behind iPad in just about every respect (the Nook color's low weight is nice though). The Xoom's screen has odd dimension when web-browsing or reading (it's nice when watching certain movies, but the experience improvement is small compared to the the reduced experience for most other applications, including non-wide-format videos). The smaller Samsung device indeed feels quite small, and, like the Xoom, it's missing nice applications in just about every major category.  Nook color is the least of all these alternatives, but perhaps the most attractive considering its lower price and light weight.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returning Mine", "Author": "Steve Kraner", "ReviewID": "RPGXM1ILH327S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Christmas I got a Kindle Fire for my wife, thinking it was simple and easy to use for a non-techie.

I worked for hours to get the iPad to do simple things like synch my music with no luck.Apple is now so intent on push marketing, like the Genius function in iTunes, that it interferes with basic functionality.I also couldn't get it to connect to my MobileMe account- apparently Apple sets up new iPads up so you cannot access MobileMe even if you have an account.The \"Genius Bar\" at the local Apple Store in Reston - which has traditionally been a good resource the few times I needed it - could not help and was manned by people who didn't care and who knew less about the software and devices than I did. They were also rude to my daughter on a visit. So I went with her the next time and got the same poor treatment and not a single problem on my list fixed.Apple is having a lot of success, but I'm concerned they may also be getting arrogant.If you are considering an iPad - beware it may be a time-sink.

So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldnt stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.So I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.If you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.For now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets.

VonCamper", "ReviewID": "R2LAI9RDEW7FTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Caveat: I'm not a techie dude (though I do enjoy some techno music... go figure, right?) so proceed cautiously with my review...)I've been brought to the iPad dragging my heels, kicking and screaming, like a bratty toddler told to eat his peas (I hate peas).My history: I've not been a fan of the proprietary and I love music.  Some years ago, before my kids bought an iPod... I owned a Creative Zen Vision M MP3 player... 60 gigs that thing carried... and I could download whatever I wanted into it... no proprietary poo and nobody needed to know my financial information or address, and I loved that lil device for that freedom.  Creative created a great product, and in fact they own a couple of patents that enable certain Apple products to work, but like Beta recording tape... a technology that was superior to VHS, yet it was popularity of the lessor product that eventually killed the chances of the better device ever really taking hold.  Similarly, from a freedom point of view.. seems like much of the MP3 market has gone the way of the dinosaur, losing out to the proprietary Apple name.  And so begins my review.To recap: I hate proprietary.  And Apple IS that: proprietary.  Having said this, and yielding to my better senses, I have made allowance to bend towards the Apple by initially purchasing my iPhone.  I still hate the proprietary... love the device; Apple, begrudgingly liked by me for the things they build, made such a great device in the iPhone that I decided to take the leap by swallowing the whole schtick and bought this iPad.This second generation, 16 gig, iPad purchase was a big one for our family... actually, for my wife (as a birthday present to her), and she's been tethered to it for two days... loves it.It's a nice sized tablet... much easier to surf the internet with a larger screen than that of an iPhone, so that's a nice plus.  As for their proprietary... if you move to Apple with the purchase of your own iPad, you'll have to give them information... personal information, to include credit card, and normally that's enough to stop me in my tracks, so if you're like me and don't easily want to part with giving this info out... this isn't the tablet for you.  But before you consider not buying this tablet for that reason, remember that once you do give in, you're introduced to a world of great products and support.As far as functionability... this iPad is basically a picture/video taking wi-fi accessing internet surfing tool (nice run-on).  Conceptually, the tablet is intuitive in it's function... if you already own an iPod/iPhone/iPad.... yet if you don't, navigation/use of this tablet is pretty easy to learn... easier still if you have someone that owns one helping you for the first 2 mins.What makes this device interesting is the ability to add applications (apps) that enable you to do a millions things with this device.  Some apps are free while some cost money... and they're found once you hit the \"App Store\" icon on your device.My iPad was purchased with the wi-fi connectibility option only; I wasn't interested in purchasing (another...) 3g AT&T; smart device usage fee, though it's an option (another model...).  As for internet connectibility, I just have to find a wi-fi site and wahla... connection, at no extra cost to me.  Sure, this doesn't make the tablet very usable while in motion, but that's not a big deal for my usage intent... so this really doesn't effect me as it would someone who's occupation relies on such mobility usage (did that make sense?  Hope so...).This tablet comes with 16 gigs of memory (same as my phone...); I have hundreds of photos and some video on my phone, but no music.  If you have an ample music collection you would like to carry/keep on this iPad, I might suggest you purchase one with a higher storage capability.  This iPad will be used by my wife and she's going to stick pictures on it, perhaps SOME music, but not much between the two; for her, 16 gigs is just right.As for other functions: it's got a camera (don't ask me for specs... look them up.  New generation iPads have newer iris'/greater photo capabilities), that can also take video.  I can do a video type conferencing with another Apple device (another iPhone/iPad, for example)... it's called \"facetime\"... that's a neat feature that my 4 year old loves when I'm at work for two days or more at a time.  Battery life seems good... charging is a snap; USB or wall... you can do both with hardware supplied.Importantly, and to their credit... Apple does a great job supporting their products (my experience with a problematic iPhone, handled by Apple Care... was top-notch).  They take care of warrantied items very well.  An additional note: Apple stores, if you 've got one close-by... are a great resource for handling warranty/problematic software issues... so the support for the product, in-store or not, is there.As for iPads or tablets in general... there are others, but even this second generation iPad makes internet connection, and use, a breeze.  After owning now... two devices, I'm a believer in the products that Apple (thus far...) have made... and though I STILL don't dig the proprietary thing, it's a reasonable trade-off for being able to use a pretty great device.I hope this review assists you in making your choice, whichever that choice may be.

Life is better now that I own one. With all the hype about it though I really expected it to be slightly better than it is.  It's hard to rate this exactly 3 or 4 stars so I'd rank it closer to four. Below summarizes why.PROs:It's amazingly fast.Amazing battery life and the exact battery remaining percentage icon is a great feature instead of the usual cellphone-like icon showing a quarter, half, etc. Battery life is really one of the best things about it.It turns on instantly and is ready for anything. Shuts down and sleeps just as quick. You almost never have to shut it down to undo a lockup. Notice I said \"almost\".Loads websites fast, and almost all apps work problem-free.Tons of content available, much of it free or just $.99Built well and damn-near bulletproof case. It looks sleek and you don't want to put it down once you start using it.It's lightweight and I don't notice it getting hot. So much more pleasant to use on the couch than a laptop. If you haven't spent an evening browsing the net from your couch with the iPad, you don't know what you're missing.CONs:Sadly the cons are quite significant in my mind. Doesn't mean I'm taking it back but kind of amazing that Apple didn't address this with the ipad2. First, the lack of flash support on the iPad is HIGHLY ANNOYING.  I cannot overstate this. I have read many reviews and talked to enough fan-boys that tell me flash is outdated and isn't going to be used much longer, HTML 5 will replace it, on and on. To that I say YEAH RIGHT.  Flash is everywhere. Many major corporations and product companies use flash on their sites. If you cant run it, you WILL miss out on content. I had no idea how big this was until i got an ipad.If you use amazon you need flash. Otherwise forget watching any product videos. To have to move to a desktop because my tablet won't do flash is unacceptable. I have heard that apple chose not to allow it due to battery life issues, but this doesn't seem like a valid enough point. It's probably more than this: political between adobe and apple. Here's a newsFLASH: how about just giving us the option to turn flash browsing off if battery life is the real reason? Maybe I'd rather have four hrs of battery life and be able to watch video than have 10 hrs of battery. This is the most glaring problem with the iPad and if you are in the market for a tablet, do your comparison shopping and check the android tablets before you decide. Wish I had. This is a problem I encounter almost every day.Lack of a back button-there is not always a way to 'back out' of an application on the ipad as there is with other tablets, again namely the android tablets. Sometimes you get knee deep in an application and hit a wall, the only way out is to hit the home bezel button which means you have to close and  start the app over. With other tablets you just go back one step.  Not a huge annoyance, but annoying nonetheless and probably happens every other day or so.Text ain't that sharp-I thought for sure owning an iPad I'd have razor sharp text just like the razor sharp graphics on the rest of the unit. Not so. Text is just 'ok'.  I just find myself having to blow things up sometime to view them clearly, and I have good vision. This may be a little knit picky... Text is fairly sharp as you enlarge and stretch content. I have read some other reviews touting sharper text on competing tablets though.Safari ain't that great either-safari is extremely limited and again apple won't let you have Firefox for the iPad. Basically I think safari provides a far less pleasing browsing experience. My main gripe is that safari will not 'wordwrap'. This means when you zoom in on a web pages the article will stroll horizontally which means extra work to have to read it. (Your home computer will wrap the text automatically, meaning the article or web page way get longer in length, but stays  only one screen length in width.... This makes for an easier reading experience).If you do lots of reading online this can get tiring constantly having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without word wrap. This isn't a problem on the kindle fire and android phones, I presume it isn't a problem on their tablets, either.The war against Google-it's no secret apple and Google will one day be even more of direct competitors than they are now, and I find that gmail sometimes just will not open on the iPad. It hangs up and locks up the unit, and I mean LOCKS UP the unit rendering the rest of safari useless until I can get it to calm down and close out.  I have no idea why but gmail is the only website that gives me a problem in safari. It's annoying and I feel unnecessary.  it's not my Internet and not my WiFi either because it works on every other computer and device in the house.  There is a gmail app, but I share the tablet with other people and kids and I want my email access separately in a browser. Sadly gmail and the iPad don't mix and that sucks.SUMMARY:Despite the gripes above the iPad is still a marvelous machine, albeit not perfect. It's loads better than using a laptop for daily surf and email. You probably won't regret buying one, and if you do the high resale value means you'll have not problem unloading it. If you are a Google or android user, you do owe it to yourself to check out the android tablets side by side before making a purchase. I can tell you for sure that for browsing the net and reading articles, Google's android built in browser is loads better than safari.  I think the iPad had been incorrectly assumed as being vastly superior because it's apple, but it has some major flaws.However even with those it is still as a whole a superb machine. It's an amazing piece of technology and far superior for web browsing than a computer or laptop. Just a personal tip--if you're on the fence about what color to get, go with white. Black is cool too, but white will stay looking cleaner (black shows every fingerprint) and will not show little nicks and scratches on the case like black will.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "thought I was buying new product", "Author": "edsnpw", "ReviewID": "R33LNBFFDXLG3Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was in the process of purchasing 26 iPad 2s over a period of 3 months for my employer when Apple switched to the new model and stopped selling the iPad 2 32GB that I need.

I use it for school (I'm practically paperless) and for entertainment. I got the 32 gigabyte model because I store a lot of apps, music, and pictures (from memebase, damn memebase.) With out further ado, here is my full review.Hardware: the hardware for the iPad is great. The aluminum body is sleek, strong, and stylish. I feel very confident in the Apple build quality to withstand most of the things I do. The plastic on the iPad is very little, and still strong. It has your usual 30 pin port on the bottom, which is huge and I don't see why they don't make a smaller one. If you liked charging your iDevice with your computer, tough luck. Only a new MacBook Pro or a new iMac can charge the iPad 2.  I have neither. All in all, I give the hardware an A+.Cases: A case is needed, however. My case is leather, and I got it for the magnetic closure, but for my use, it just isn't sturdy enough. Right now. I'm using rooCASE Dual Station Premium Leather (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad in red; I couldn't find the red one in the product link section. With out a case or with a poor case, the corners will get pretty scuffed up and ugly. Also, on mine, the black plastic color part is kind of peeling. It's not that bad, though. Mind you that i'm a student, so I might do more things than you do. I recommend you get the Speck Products CandyShell Wrap for iPad 2 - DarkLord Black (SPK-A0418). I just ordered it from Amazon $20 cheaper than from the Speck site.iOS 5: I am at iOS 5.0.1, and for some reason, my iPad won't let me upgrade to 5.1. There isn't a huge difference, so don't feel like you are missing out.  The iOS is great. Everything is smooth, and the Internet browsing is great with the tabs. You can even split the keyboard in two and type with your thumbs, which is,neat, but not useful until you really learn how to use it. iCloud is also great. Every app I download on my iPhone gets downloaded on my iPad, and vice versa. Really useful. Still no freaking flash, though. There is an app you can download called Photon flash web browser, which lets you run flash programs. Really great for watching FLASH videos, if you know what I mean. I HAD TO! I HAD TO! I'm sorry. That was the dumbest thing ever, but you get what I mean. I rate the OS an A-Battery: I love the battery life, and at school, if I don't use it a lot, I can use it for another day. It has by far the best battery life of any LCD screen device I have. 'nuff said, A+Speed: the iPad is super quick with its A5 processor, running apps like a charm and browsing the Internet sometimes faster than my laptop. Hell. It is  probably is faster than my laptop. If you want something fast, it's definitely something to consider. A+Weight: not too heavy, but not too light either. Feels perfect. It fits in my booksack, so it's good for me. AOne thing that makes me rate it 4 stars is the AirPrint or whatever Apple calls it. (my iPad recognized the word and spellchecked it, so I think I that's right) It's complete crap. There are only a select few printers that it can print to, and you have to jailbreak if you want otherwise. It's so dumb, and I print things a lot. I truly hate it. I am soon going to buy the network printing app on Cydia, so that will soon be gone, but still. Bad choice, Apple.All in all, I rate the iPad 2 an A. If you want to save some money, buy the iPad 2 instead of the new iPad, but if it's your starting model and you don't care about the price, go with the  Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL. The only reason to but this one is if you are price-conscious and the new iPad is too much for you.

The iPad 2 is sleeker, much thinner and lighter.  These are big differences if you plan on doing a lot of reading on the device and need to hold it for extended periods of time.  The camera is a nice-to-have addition.  The iPhone 4 has a better camera and is easier to use when taking pictures - the iPad is a bit bulky to use as a camera.  Also, for me, cellular connectivity is a must since I travel frequently and can't always rely on a WiFi signal.  Cellular data plans are about $25/month, so if you don't need it, you can save a fair bit of money.  I might still recommend getting the device with the cellular antenna - you can enable it when you need it and cancel data plans when you don't.

I have a Windows phone paired with a Mac computer.  So, I generally buy products based on the product rather than the company. At first, I was completely against getting an iPad, since I figured that my Mac could do anything that my phone couldn't. I broke down my favorite aspects and least favorite aspects of the iPad 2 (not software, but hardware):Favorites:1) The weight distribution of the tablet: It doesn't seem to be too heavy, or too light (as in cheap).2) Materials: I was leaning more toward a Android tablet, but the materials that went into those felt so cheap to me. The iPad 2 has a great aluminum feel to the back, with a glossy front.  I miss the Gorilla Glass of my Samsung phones though, since I never needed a screen protector.3) Everything just works:  If you have ever had an Android phone, you understand what I mean. Occasionally, the Android OS just freezes, or crashes (at least on my previous phone).  When you press the home button, there is no lag.  This has more to do with the software of the iPad (iOS 5). True, it is more of a restricted OS than the Android OS, but its a sacrifice I was willing to make.4) The prestige that comes with an iPad:  This may sound shallow, but I didn't not want to have to defend my position of getting an Android tablet over an iPad.  This holds its value long into the future, verses lesser known Android tablets.5) Clean lines:  A minimalistic design.  Clean cut, very stylish.Least Favorite:1) True, the iPad is very balanced, but it does get heavy when reading after awhile.  If you are looking for an ereader and won't be going into the features of the iPad, then don't buy it.  Buy the Kindle Fire or another device.2) Every accessory seems to be (excluding a few of course) very expensive.  If you want a good deal, you have to be willing to hunt for awhile, buy used, or pony up the extra money to buy the protective case, or screen protector, etc.3) I still feel nervous carrying it around with me. Its a double edge sword... yes, I love the prestige that comes with the ipad, but so do the thieves.Overall, this review isn't going to make someone who doesn't want one, buy an iPad.  What I must say is: if you have never used an iPad, don't hate on iPad owners.  After using this for awhile, I can't understand my hesitation at first to buy one, or why I waited so long.Advice: rumors are swirling about the next iPad (claims to be iPad 3).

I have now started calling it crApple. All they do it market this product as if it is the best thing in the world, but it is definitely not.So why 3 stars.Pros:Yes there is some good stuff, but I do not know how unique it is to Apple. Size, weight and battery life is super. You can use it the whole day, and angry birds is seriously addictive. It remembers each network and its settings so that I do not have to manually change proxy settings everytime I move from office to another place.Cons:Everyone has said it but I'll say it again: No flash = No point! It is so annoying that you have to keep going from one applet to another to do things that you can normally do on a browser. Seriously, if you tube just decided to use flash and to remove their App I think Apple would go bankrupt.Editing stuff is impossible or as difficult as doing it on your phone, with the exception of a larger keyboard. Speaking of the keyboard I cannot for the life of me understand why apple cannot put arrow keys on it! So annoying! Yes there is a magnifier which allows you to scroll the cursor but how tedious it is!A lot of the other stuff has been mentioned in other reviews but these were teh maain points for me.Also - a note for people considering a laptop or this - buy a laptop. This is the 3rd thing you need.This is really ideal for someone who has a large heavy laptop which stays in one place and needs a lighter device to carry around for just brisk surfing, checking mail, watching some youtube and playing games (ie a bigger version of an iPhone).However, if I knew what I know now I would never have bought this thing. I would wait until google improves Android or microsoft comes up with some hardware that will kick Apple of its perch, because there is nothing like a normal windows operating system. I need flash, I need to be able to open, edit and  attach my edited files to gmail through a browser. I need flash (yes I said it again). I also want to be able to download whatever software I like and run it, without it having to be a mobile App.I think what has happened is that I made the mistake of thinking that the bigger screen meant that this was a real computer, rather than just another mobile device with all its limitation.

Because by the time I realized it was more than a 'silly' toy everyone was talking about the 2nd generation.I am VERY glad I did and here's why:1. The 2nd generation is much faster than the original.2. The design, while very similar is more sleek and lighter.3. The cameras are a great addition.Video Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.Convenience - I take this to class and with the addition of a bluetooth keyboard I am able to easily take notes in class while carrying FAR less than my laptop in weight.- The battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)- The app store is getting better all the time - there are plenty of applications that make using this extremely convenient without having to take the laptop around (it weighs around 1/5 that of my laptop)- even if you bring the charger - it's far less bulky than the laptop charger.This really is the future of mobile computing. The touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.The majority of my iphone apps work on this tablet.The only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions.If you waited the first time - wait no longer - very much worth it in my mind.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "The ipad 1,2,3, and 4", "Author": "Jo Apple \"Jo\"", "ReviewID": "RLHS8GHEA78HP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the ipad 4 now and I have had all of the other I pads except the first generation.

If you wear glasses and/or have trouble with blurriness and stuff then by all means upgrade to the 3, but the 4th generation is not even a noticeable difference.  It does have a faster processor but not Samsung fast, so if given the choice go with the 2nd generation if its a lot cheaper than 3rd generation. If the 2nd and 3rd are close in price go for the 3rd generation.To sum it up1st generation- good for a kid2nd generation- good if you can get it for a lot less than the 3rd generation.3rd generation- good for people who can use every bit of clearness in reading/suffer from blurriness, cant find a good deal on a 3rd generation.4th generation- if you want normal speed service, its not super fast but it is average which is good.Now if you are trying to decide between the iPad and the samsung. You cant compare Apples and oranges. apples are apples and oranges are androids. the samsung is much much much faster and allows you to use flash, but in my opinion that is all.

It's a beautiful product, as with all other Apple products I have purcThe hased however.....the Wi-Fi capability is not so good. It works for a while and then stops working. I called Apple. They had me delete the password for my network and then put the password back in. It worked fine for a while...just as it did when I first installed it. But only for a while. I don't get it. I have a relatively new Belkin 2 wireless network on Cable and have been using it for several years. I have two laptop computers, two printers, and an iPod touch with Wi Fi. They all work just fine. I can work all day, every day on any of these devices from anywhere in my house or in my yard.But not with the iPAD 2.with the iPad 2 it works for a while and then stops working. Very frustrating.This is not only a review but a request for help if anyone knows what's going on.BELOW IS A FOLLOW-UP ON MY IPAD2:BTW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THIS, HERE IS A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS:1. It never worked properly on my home network or other networks I tried at Starbucks, shopping centers, etc.2. It was too big and heavy.3. To read a book on it was a problems because it was heavy and just touching a little part of the screen caused pages to flip by very fast which meant I had to search for where I was about every few minutes.4. Even though I bought a 2 years warranty, sent it in for repair and eventually got a new/used one from Apple it still never solved any of the problems.5. Apple never would do anything substantive for me...like give me my money back or give me an Apple credit. So in the end I had to sell it for what I could get - $400, which meant I lost $250+plus the accessories, apps, the Warranty etc. I had spent.I am NOT an Apple basher and I enjoy my iPods (3) we have in our family. However, I'll never buy Apple again because of their \"return\" \"credit\" etc. policy. They have really made me unhappy with this experience and I did everything I could to work with them.I got an iPad2 with 32Gig memory ($599) + a \"magic cover\" ($60) from Loretta for my birthday this year. The \"magic cover\" is magnetic. It covers and protects the screen of the iPad2 when you're not using it and turns the machine on and off by putting the cover on and off. I also bought an $80 2-year warranty service. So all in all, without tax and shipping, we spent about $720 for the thing. The short story is the iPad2 didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay connected to our network. Every time I wanted to use it I had to go through the network settup process all over again. Apple Customer Service was no help. After hours with them I sent it in for \"repair.\" I got it back and it worked exactly the same, which is to say, it didn't work exactly as it didn't work before I sent it in. I kept asking for my money back or a credit but they kept refusing. Finally I sent it to them and they sent me a \"new\" (i.e. new to ME) unit. That's right, they did NOT say they would give me a new iPad2. They said they would give me a \"refurbished\" unit. I thought this was crappy since I'd only owned the thing for a month and had spent most of that time on the phone with their service department. Anyway, I got a \"new\" unit and it worked the same...i.e. it didn't work. Again, they refused to give me my money or a credit. So I finally just sold it. I got $400 for it so we lost about $350 (with shipping and tax).Besides not hooking up to our network, it was also big and heavy and no fun to sit and read books or browse the web or do any of the things I wanted it for. Reading a book, for example was a hassle. You had to hold this big heavy thing by the very edge of the \"frame\" because if you touched the screen anywhere it would flip through pages FAST and I spent most of my time trying to find where I left off. A real pain.Apart from all of that, the iPad2 is beautiful, has a beautiful screen and presents a beautiful, rich, colorful picture of whatever you're viewing. But not that much better than my Dell laptop.By the way, I KNOW our network works. It's the most recent Belkin WAP2 system and it works flawlessly with both of our Dell laptops, our DELL wireless color printer and our Brother wireless Laser Printer. I also had an Apple iPod Touch which worked perfectly using our same Wireless network. So it HAD to be something in the iPad2 that just didn't work. Anyway, I don't think I'll buy anything more from Apple, mainly because that even when something doesn't work right out of the box they won't give your money back or even give you a credit.What I DID buy and am very happy with, is an Amazon Kindle Latest Generation Wi Fi for $140 + $60 for a leather cover with built in reading light which actually works.The networking on the Kindle works great...just like our Dell Laptops and our printers.For more money, you can get a Kindle with not only Wi Fi but also 3G, so it will work using your phone network as well as your home network. We didn't need that feature though.The Kindle is great for reading books, magazines, newspapers, etc. You can get thousands of free books, but current books, or subscriptions to periodicals will cost you. If I was still traveling I'd get the 3G and subscribe to the NY Times but I can't read all of the news I want to (which isn't much) on my computer.What I do like, is reading books on the Kindle. You can set up your machine with the font, font size, number of words per line, etc. etc. so that everything you read is the same in terms of those features.You can shop for books at Amazon from your computer or from your Kindle using the Wi Fi or 3G system.It's black and white, but that's OK with me.It's small and light weight and very easy to use.The leather cover with built in light is a really nice feature. The light works off of the Kindle battery, which lasts about a month and charges up in less than an hour.Reading in bed, the light shines only on the Kindle page so it doesn't bother anyone else in bed with you.I've got about 100 books on my Kindle right now. All of them I got free from either Amazon or Gutenberg. When you \"buy\" from Gutenberg or some other free source you just download the file (in Kindle format) and email it to a special email address you get which is then on Amazon.Anytime you turn on your Kindle it automatically downloads whatever you've bought from Amazon or sent to Amazon from where you bought it.It also does audio books and works the same way with those. However, you have to plug in earphones of course, to listen.It holds 3500 books, so I've got plenty of room left.Anyway, if you're interested in an \"eReader\" I can recommend the Kindle over the iPad2.If you're interested in something with which to browse the web, I say, stick to a laptop.I know Apple makes some beautiful products, but I think the iPad2 is a flop for what I wanted to use it for.I think it's great for playing games on or looking at photos or maybe even watching a movie (after you've downloaded it) but I wouldn't want to try to watch a movie using \"streaming\" because of the networking issue.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A truly useful device that makes a PC much less necessary", "Author": "S. Jentsch", "ReviewID": "R374CVRZO4753Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After five months of using a 16GB iPad 2 WiFi (no 3G), I can honestly say that it is one of the most useful technology purchases I can think of. While its price may scare many people away, its usefulness can justify its price, especially when compared to other devices that perform similar tasks. Not a day has gone by in the last five months where the iPad 2 hasn't been used several times, usually by several family members.Apple would like everyone to think that the iPad is revolutionary. Skeptics and critics scoff at the idea, but I would agree that it is a revolutionary product much in the same way that the Netbook (ASUS eeePC, et al) was a revolutionary product.Both products created a new paradigm in how you look at accessing information, media, and other tasks, and once you use them, you find it difficult to go back to the traditional devices. Netbooks nearly killed laptops, but in turn are getting killed themselves by tablets. People loved the small size of netbooks, but the keyboards and displays were often too small. Compared to an iPad, a typical netbook is too clunky and too heavy. Those with the need for a keyboard need the larger keyboard that a laptop provides, and those that don't embraced tablets as quickly as they could.Using the iPad for any length of time will make you not want to use your desktop PC for browsing the web or reading E-Mail. It's much more natural to hold a tablet in your lap or place it on the table next to you while having breakfast than it is to go into the other room and use a PC to do the same. Laptops are more portable than desktop PC's, but in comparison, they are much bulkier and many laptops have horrible battery life that don't come close to the 10 hours that one can get from the iPad 2.That's not to say that desktop and laptop PC's don't have their place. They definitely do. If you're doing anything complex that requires a keyboard or a mouse, those other devices shine. However, if you're composing a normal E-Mail, browsing the web, reading news feeds, checking Facebook, or watching videos on Hulu or YouTube, the iPad does these things very well. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, especially in landscape mode, is very easy and I've gotten quite fast at doing so. The picture quality on the screen is very good; probably better than most laptop and desktop PC monitors are, and the touch interface is so natural that it doesn't require hardly any orientation to get comfortable using the interface.Browsing the web is a joy on the 10\" screen. Sure, not having Flash compatibility is a pain sometimes, but Flash is one of those technologies of the past that is dwindling in popularity with the advent of HTML5, and it's in the site owner's best interests to develop versions of their sites that don't rely on Flash to do things that should have been done in other ways long before iOS devices came along. It's an occasional annoyance, but I don't consider the lack of Flash a dealbreaker in my mind. Web sites that don't work on the iPad are losing the business of the many that have iOS-based devices, and there are plenty of other sites that provide the same service that don't lean on the Flash crutch.Reading E-Mail using the built-in E-Mail app is also very good. I prefer the sidebar list of E-Mails that appears in landscope mode over the popup menu listing in portrait mode, but that's a personal preference. GMail integration is smooth, and being able to access multiple accounts makes it easy to check several mailboxes, either in one megalist or as separate accounts. The calendar app integrates with Google Calendar and the contacts from GMail are available in the Contacts list on the iPad as well. The integration with Google's various apps is very good.One of the best features of the iPad is the ecosystem that is built around the device. Apple has done a great job of supplying a major part of that by creating an AppStore with thousands of apps for just about every purpose one could think of. The iTunes store provides music, movies, and books for sale, but I prefer supplying my own music and movies, and Amazon's Kindle app / Kindle books is much more flexible and a better way to buy books in my opinion. On top of the software, the popularity of the iPad means that there are multitudes of accessories that cover the iPad, plug into the iPad, or otherwise complement the iPad in some way. No other portable device manufacturer has the 3rd party support that Apple has and that advantage shouldn't be overlooked.Speaking of accessories, I did a lot of looking at cases, and I settled on the AYL\u00ae 100% Premium Genuine Slim Leather Case Folio with Magnetic Closure and 3-in-1 built-in Stand for Apple Ipad 2nd Generation Tablet (Black). It's a folio style cover that works very well in protecting the device while not adding too much bulk. I highly recommend getting some kind of case, and this one is nearly perfect.The iPad 2 costs a lot of money. That makes it out of reach of some people, so it's not a slam-dunk. However, if you compare it to the cost of a new laptop or desktop PC, it's not out of line. If you're reading E-Mail, looking at videos, and browsing the web, the iPad does these things very well. You'll still need another device that will store your digital camera photos, keep track of your finances, and do the complex tasks that a desktop/laptop can do, but you'll need that device much less once you've discovered the ease of using something like this for those everyday tasks that don't require a full-sized keyboard and full-blown Windows programs to accomplish.No other tablet device currently available on the market has come close to the capabilities and the ecosystem that the iPad enjoys. I had hopes that the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only) would take it on, but it seems hampered by software issues (trying to do too much and be too flexible can be troublesome), the Androad app market still trails the iOS app market considerably, and the number of accessories available pales in comparison.The best non-iOS device that I think has a chance of being a contender is the Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi. It has a great price point, it has Amazon standing behind it with an ecosystem that includes an AppStore, music store, video store for TV and movies, and the excellent Kindle books system, which is almost an ecosystem all by itself. I'm very interested to see how the Kindle Fire accomplishes the tasks of a tablet device and I hope that it can be a contender in the marketplace.Anyone interested in a tablet device should be looking at the major products that are available and see how those products serve their needs. While the iPad 2 is a major investment, I don't regret making the purchase.

Ease of use is above and beyond any computing device I've ever had. Yes it's mostly a \"consumption device\", but that's about 90% of what I do at home. And for the other 10% (sending email, shopping, etc) the various apps work terrific.

My library went from a couple of hundred pounds of books to something that I can carry around with me at all times in my Timbuk2 bag.- Watched \"Prohibition\" Ken Burns mini-series on the plane to Key West with my girlfriend (that I easily transferred from my TiVo to my iPad).

A. Luster \"The Rook\"", "ReviewID": "R3DDO9RE3KWXA3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Apple's iPad 2 is a huge hit at our house. My wife got one and I was so jealous I insisted I needed one as well. The uses are almost limitless. Best of all it is great for creating documents (writing novels), surfing the web, listening to music, and playing Apple games. In fact I only have one complaint about the lack of compatability with the Adobe Flash Player. Because of this it keeps you from playing a great many games including those on Facebook and other sites. Additionally certain videos at some sites will only play with the Adobe Flash Player. I hope in the interest of customer needs this will change in the future. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the iPad 2. I even got a Rover App-Controlled Spy Tank with Night Vision to remotely control with the iPad so my wife and I can watch the house and cats remotely. That brings some peace of mind, not to mention the Rover is a blast to play with.You can purchase cases and accessories to attach your iPad to your cars headrest to allow others to watch movies while traveling. There are a plethora of accessories for the iPad 2 so you will have plenty to choose from for covers, cases, adaptors, keyboards, et cetera. There are numerous apps that you can download to make it great for work and/or play. The apps can be free or range up to about twenty dollars on average. Most those I got were free or around four to seven dollars. I use mine extinsively because I can carry it anywhere and I don't have to sit at a desk to work on projects or listen to music and play games. If you're a highly mobile person this is a must have tool/toy.I imagine most students want one to make their homework easier to work on at school or home. Because of the decent drive space and WiFi you can almost do anything that you could do on a full size workstation whether you use a PC or Mac. Since you can even buy cases with keyboards it can easily replace a laptop for a lot less money and portability. Small enough to carry in a daily planner or purse it wins hands down in portability. Since you can now back files up on the web and use webmail it alleviates the headaches of more complex and costly workstation choices. You will still require a workstation to interface with for printing, transferring some files, USB transfers, and certain other functions. But at least when you need portability you will have it.Addendum: Although I am slightly disappointed that the iPad 3 came out on the heals of my purchase, I can't complain really as mine was purchased more for functionality than graphics.  One reader asked me if the WiFi was an issue to set up.  I didn't have any trouble with it.  In fact it's far easier than setting it up on a PC.  Once you set it up it automatically goes out and looks for a connection and will ask you which server to connect.  The beauty of it is if you decide you don't want to pay a monthly fee is you can just disable it until you want to use that feature again.  Now that the price has dropped on them, unless you need high resolution for movies or graphics, I recommend you seriously consider the iPad 2.CA Luster", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Boy, Did I surprise her!", "Author": "Brian J.

I would tell people \"I have an iPhone so why get just a bigger version?\"  My wife wanted to get an e-reader so I decided to put my money where my mouth was and buy a couple of iPads for us.  Hers would likely be a casual use device but I was going to try to use mine for business moving to a paperless work style (attempt #1,324 over the course of 12 years of different devices).Initial review was good... liked the device feel, weight, etc.  Clearly it looked nice.  I was offended at the cost of covers and accessories but I had somewhat gotten over that shock with the iPhone so it wasn't a new shock :) I felt that a lot of the app makers did a good job with their iPhone/iPad combined apps but it does suck to have to buy a separate app for those that don't have the combined versions.  But, overall a nice design and fun product to use.But, there's a big but here, it's too fragile and no recourse from an accident.  Like many others before me I broke mine.  Total bone-head move on my part, not at all an Apple fault in my situation, but if you spend some time reviewing forums you'll see the advice I failed to read.  The device is incredibly fragile so even simple (aka not bone-headed) slips, drops, and bumps will leave you with a busted screen.  With no attractive means of recourse.  One would think that any product with a propensity for a major functional piece to break there would be a repair option.  Not the case with Apple.  Probably part of the business plan to be honest.  I tried to find out my options and costs (secretly hoping for a free replacement like others have touted) but two different stores told me 1) not repairable by anyone; 2) any signs or attempt at repair void warranty; and 3) only option is a \"courtesy\" replacement for $270 (16mb wifi version).  No option for repair internally at Apple, let alone an option more reasonable than spending another $300.  I checked and the local repair place quoted about $185 plus tax and the parts I found online looked to run about $150+.  For a glass screen!Apple has a unique luxury in that they have a large client base that feels Apple can do no wrong.  An Apple \"genius\" could swing by the house at Thanksgiving and slap the loyalists grandmother and Apple would still be held up on a pedestal - the turkey was dry after-all.  So they don't bat an eye if iTunes misbehaves (the user shouldn't have tried to sync contacts), or if they try to connect with Outlook (the user shouldn't consider another product not made by Apple), or consider a good product would have given repair considerations to a critical yet fragile component.  The Apple flock is a great thing to have for a business.So anyway, I would say the iPad is a great device.  It'd be better if the screen were more widget based like the android options, but it's snazzy, quick, and a joy to use.  But, leave it sitting alone on the desk and protect it with your life if you buy it.  Otherwise buy an android option for half the price and if you could bust it three times and still be less expensive than the Apple will arguably as good of performance.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "MY FIRST IPAD", "Author": "Diane Tulli", "ReviewID": "RWLYPJOIXXIN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS MY FIRST I PAD.

I noticed a trend when i start going deep into the reviews and previews of competitor tablets, and that trend was that everything hoped to rival the iPad. There are decent alternatives, but unfortunately the iPad is still the tablet to beat.I choose the iPad 2 of the iPad 3, because for the upgrades from the predecessor were not of any interest. I take photos on a dslr, and if i want to watch HD videos then i can watch them on my laptop.So far i am guilt fully enjoying the iPad 2. It has proved to me more useful than I envisioned: It's productivity apps work across multiple platforms, it's home to one of my favorite card games (magic 2013!), and it's internationally user friendly (chinese gf).My biggest complaint is more on the OS and hardware side of things.

Through gritted teeth whilst my friends enjoyed the cute novelty of the first release, I sweated out the wait for the version with the itty bitty webcameras and it was well worth the wait.  What is the point if you can't skype or facetime?An iPad is simply handicapped without a webcam, well, Apple made up for it with a vengence by having TWO in version 2! One at the back one at the front to toggle between.  Making self-photography a breeze to compose and shoot with minimal error.  FaceTime, the apple version of skype now comes bundled to facilitate easy \"skype-ing\" between iPad owners (akin to free video calls on the back of a wifi network).  This is video networking made accessible to the masses.This also becomes your camera and video camera for web publishing - the resolution though not the highest is laudable. And the pixel warehouse for your digital camera to download to when one is travelling.Like the iPhone, the iPad further usurps the position of the iPod relegating it further into the abyss of obsolescence - by incorporating a digital iPod inside for portable music & video storage and playback. It is not hard to allow one's life to revolve around this little tablet which makes it both a great productivity & recreational tool. Akin the hp's iPaq in 2004 except much more versatile graphically and with a much improved touchscreen.The plethora of apps available at the Apple appStore is like a digital candy store (hundreds of thousands). So much to sample so much to buy.  Brilliant marketing to make it so cheaply available.

As for connectivity, it is only WiFi, so it can have its limitations as far as access to online informations are concerned, but with the IPhones handy, it is kind of OK.What makes it different from the Iphones and the ITouch is primarily the display size, which on many occasions are far more feasible than the smaller units. There is just so many things that are much better on a bigger screen than it be on the smaller units, net browsing and entertainment, not to mention the Medical Programs that are available in the iTunes store. And that is an other plus for the unit, all being the same brand, they are all synchronized and maintained through a single account, which makes the control of context so much easier compared to having different brands units, organized with different environments and operating systems.As for the connectivity issue, it being only WiFi, I have a HUB that allows me to connect 5 wifi units on one 3G network, and thou I must admit I have not used it that often yet, but it has it's benefits.12/26/2011: just had to add this small remark to my review.

That being despite it is only a WiFi unit. I have to say, that is rather marvellous ....For the unit, for maintain, a Screen protector is highly recommended. Given the fact that it is a touch screen, even if the protector gets scratched up, you can just replace that instead of having to replace the screen itself. Also, a hard case is recommended, in my case, MA Hon got me a book case, which fold and serves as a stand as well. As for a stylus, a Soft Rubber unit is the best, I have a belkin, but I am sure you be able to find some less expensive ones that serves the purpose just as well.I have had the unit for 10 days now, and have yet to explore MANY options available, but given the fact that I have been using the Apple's units for years now, it is all coming easy. But I can highly recommend it. Surely the Apple products are a bit pricy compared to some of the competing units, but for my needs, the compatibility and access that it offers with the other units that I possess, it is worth the couple of extra bucks.

However, the quality of these cameras are nowhere near the standards that one expects to see from a piece of technology, especially at the price that Apple charges. Apple cites that the small mega-pixel camera is the result of a thin design, which I understand. I do not use my IPad to take pictures, I do however carry it everywhere. It's thin and light design enables me to slip it in to that last little space of room in my backpack without adding much weight.Media and GraphicsFor those of you that are on the go, you can use the IPad for games, music, videos, and even writing word documents. I however, do not like watching movies on my IPad, because any movie that comes from Itunes is only in wide screen format which makes the actual movie frame very small. That and the not so great quality of movie graphics, makes me reluctant to do so. The graphics on the IPad 2 are good when not watching movies, when watching they are are not terrible but they are not great, and can be vastly improved.The KeyboardWhat bothers me the most about the IPad 2 is the keyboard, the letters are shrunk so that the keyboard can fit, but it was not done proportionally.

Bugs and other device problems aren't something you come to expect from Apple because of the tireless work that goes into making sure the manufactured parts work together in harmony. This was something manufacturers of other tablets did not do when they rushed their way to the market Apple was claiming all to itself. The result was a number of products, most of which had bugs or other serious performance problems.Anyway, the iPad 2 bulked up a bit from its predecessor. A dual core processor and a little more RAM helped keep this device up with the Johnsons, spec-wise. Usability-wise, it's still as friendly to the user as can be. The interface isn't complicated and anyone familiar with how an iPhone works will have no problem getting into this device right away.Cameras on front and back were added. It's a shame they couldn't get a HD camera sensor in the device because that would make Facetime all the better. As it is, the video quality isn't that great but it does what it says it does and the video chat function works pretty nice. The back camera? Never used it and don't plan to.Then there is the App Store itself. Instead of paying $69.99 every time you need to feed your kid's hunger for a new game, you can drop 99 cents for most applications, whether they are games or educational apps or any of the vast amount of programs created that fit anyone's budget. As tablets become more and more popular, more and more content is finding its way onto the device. ABC has a player where you can watch their new shows in their entirety. HBO has one, too. Doctors are using these devices as they make patient records easily available. Teachers use these to track grades for their classes and educational apps help them figure out what subject matter their students may be struggling with. And these are just two niche examples of what the device can do. As an everyday consumer, you can really shape this device around your life and even find applications that make your professional life easier.For a portable, in your bed experience, this works wonders. The backlight trims when it detects low lighting so your eyes won't strain. The 10 inch screen is more than enough for watching Netflix or other content you can stream (I use AirVideo since I have a lot of media on my home machine and it streams it all -- .AVI, .MKV, .MP4 -- perfectly).If you take this wifi model out of the house and find yourself in places where you don't have wifi access, you can still use whatever apps you have that don't require an Internet connection, or you can play videos that you store on the device. Since this is Apple we're talking about, you can find apps that will play any kind of media so you aren't stuck with just the .MP4 codec that Apple would prefer you use.There aren't many limitations to the device...Adobe Flash support is usually cited among the things people don't like about the device. Good news on that front: Adobe is abandoning Flash for mobile devices (in part because they can't fix the non-stop security holes Flash has) so eventually that won't be a concern. Steve Jobs said Adobe Flash was garbage and didn't get support for it with the iPad. Other manufacturers chose to include Flash but it didn't take long before they admitted it killed the battery life on their devices, while the iPad2 can go all day without needing a charge. Watch movies all day. Play games all day. You don't need this hooked up to a power outlet all the time like you would a laptop and this is much easier to carry around, so the number of situations you can use this device (waiting rooms, long car trips, air travel) goes way up.There are many things to like about this device and there are some drawbacks (no USB support besides tethering to your computer, no HDMI, no Adobe Flash and no expanded memory card slots. But they are few and nearly insignificant when you realize there are alternatives to the roadblocks you think you may face, including cloud storage.This tablet is the cream of the crop.

In fact, I generally loathe having to deal with computers and technology. Unfortunatly, since I own my own business I spend a large part of my day sending e-mails, processing orders, and doing book keeping, so much of my day is spent interacting with technology. I also spend a good portion of my day on the road, and until recently I had to lug my laptop around. Whenever I found down time, wherever I was, I'd have to bring it out, wait for it to boot up, log on to the internet, get my work done, then wait for it to shut down. It got the job done, but it was heavy and awkward to carry around, and uncomfortable to use in the car.I'd been considering switching to a tablet for a long time, and when I finally decided to go ahead and make the switch I researched every tab on the market. I spent a lot of time testing tabs at the electronics stores. Some just weren't very intuitive, and getting them to perform required more effort than I was willing to invest. Some were choppy. Some seemed to crash every 5 minutes.The one that always operated beautifully was the Ipad 2. Unfortunately, my business requires that I watch videos my clients send me, and the lack of flash support worried me. Ultimately I decided I could use the Ipad on the road and watch whatever videos I couldn't get to play when I got home to my computer.Set up was very easy - and I'm not the most computer literate guy. Downloaded Itunes, plugged the Ipad in, and it was up and running. Within an hour the lack of flash support became annoying... Then I did a bit of research and found an App for $4.99 that allowed me to view flash on my Ipad flawlessly! The Ipads one limitation was solved for less than $5.00! Now I have Apps that simplify every element of my business. Maps, record keeping, creating documents...The Ipad is wonderful to travel with. Day to day, on the road locally, it is light and slim, easy to take with my wherever I go. When I need to access records or check my e-mail I no longer have to wait for my laptop to boot up, with the touch of a button my Ipad is up and running, and on the internet moments later.The battery life is stunning... It keeps me entertained and/or productive on long flights, and in hotel rooms in unfamiliar cities.I very rarely use my laptop since I got my Ipad. My Ipad does everything my laptop did for me, only it usually does it faster and easier.

I wish it were a completely independant device so I could just set my laptop aside completely and let it gather dust.The Ipad isn't 100% perfect. The camera isn't impressive at all. Watching flash requires downloading and using a seperate web browser app (I generally use Safari, overall its a better browser than the flash enabled one.

I spend many hours at various sporting practices each week and for the past two years, the touch has kept me entertained (I actually looked forward to practice since it gave me at least two hours to sit and catch up on everything).The iPad has taken it to a whole new level.  I have more reading material than I can read (books, magazines, email, etc.).  I love Netflix and HBO GO and I use it to stargaze at night (it can control my telescope through an app).  The entire family likes it so much that It's made the touches obsolete.  My husband who never liked the touch keeps taking my iPad.

Naturally, I was impressed at how quick and easy it was to use.  A lot of thought has gone into the product and it shows.  Instant on (I have the magnetic cover) is a bonus and the screen - large and crystal clear - is not so much a selling point but rather a \"how to\" example for other tablet manufacturers to follow.The Apple store in the meatpacking district of New York City has a qualified, and very friendly, staff who set the unit up for me while they answered my various questions. Considering that they had been doing this since 5 PM and it was now after 10, that is a lot of dedication for one staff!  The most amazing thing is: they were all quite proud of the iPad 2. It says a lot when the company employees are that loyal.And the iPad 2 deserves such praise.  The product is, in short, wonderful.  Light weight yet with a solid feel to it, I plan on taking mine to Europe shortly.  After you turn it on, the balance of the iPad 2 is self-explanatory.  From the opening screen of icons, the touch screen makes it almost too-easy to take the product that seriously. But it is a useful tool what with a Calendar, notebook, iPod, photo studio, etc. Naturally the much hearalded APP STORE is there and works fine and at a lightning speed.  Although I wonder about the \"10 hour battery life\" claim - it does manage to work long enough to please the most diligent of users.Where the iPad falls short is in the area of productivity.  Much discussed, and a sore point, is the lack of a USB port. In todays day and age, that is almost an unforgivable sin. I did get the hook up so I could download my pictures (it works too - and, again, it does it so fast and so effortlessly that it is a minor miracle). There is something almost childish in the decision not to include at least one USB port especially after the loud fracas that happened after the release of the first iPad.  FLASH is another sore point and, frankly, one that I don't understand. There is some conflict going on with the world of APPLE and flash so we don't have it. This makes it very difficult to surf the web. Safari is quick but without flash, it misses one of its major components. Again, and this is just my feeling, this is something that could have been corrected quite easily - starting a year ago with the original.  Now, the iPad 2 (and the original version, I'm sure) can still do quite an amazing amount of work without these two features but as they are considered standard, it is a puzzle as to why the iPad 2 did not have both of them installed.  Also, the lack of a port decreases the iPad's place in the workforce. How can you install, let's say, OFFICE MAC?  The system can print (via Bluetooth) so it could be used as an Office-on-the-run (held landscape, the keyboard is quite easy to do some very fast typing upon - one could produce an awful lot of work on it but . . . without a CD drive to install programs, it makes it difficult).Other than that, the unit is nothing short of brilliant.

I commute on the train to work, so I got the 3G version for connectivity when I am out of wifi range.  With AT&T;, it is a reasonable $25 a month for 2 gigs of data transfer, and that is more than enough.  And I can turn the 3G plan on and off on a month-by-moth basis if I don't think I'll need it.This thing is so much more than its specs.  Here's what I use it for:  My email, both personal and work; reading Kindle and iBooks; reading the NY Times in the train, as well as checking about half a dozen other news sites for the latest information; reading magazines in their full-color glory (I recommend Zinio); watching movies and TV (Netflix streaming, Hulu Plus, ABC, You Tube and more -  it's been a godsend since last week's hurricane, which lunched my living room TV); participating in discussion forums and blogs; checking Facebook; shopping, shopping, shopping; checking weather; getting maps and navigation; having video chats with friends; using Skype for landline calls when I was in Spain and couldn't use my iPhone; playing with jigsaw puzzles, my favorite time suck.  There's much, more more, but I'd be here all night.I know that other Android-based tablets can do most of these things and can even do something's that iPad cannot.  But I love the look and feel of the iPad -  it feels very light in my hands, even with a leather cover.  And I love the incredible range of apps available from Apple.  Some Apple-haters would accuse me of \"drinking the Apple KoolAid\" and let them.  All I know is that this is the best piece of personal technology that has yet been invented.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do you really need the iPad 2?", "Author": "Cynthia \"cdeluz\"", "ReviewID": "R2WZ7A10HXJFLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the original iPad 64GB with Wifi back in October of last year.  If I had know that an updated model was going to become available so soon, I would have waited for the iPad 2. So, do you really need the iPad 2?  Frankly, there are three major differences between the original iPad and the iPad 2.  First, the iPad 2 is noticeably lighter and sleeker.  It is more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time, especially if you like to read e-newspaers or ebooks. Secondly, the iPad 2's processor is a lot speedier.  Page turns are quick, boot time is fast, and surfing the internet is a breeze. Last of all, the iPad 2 has a camera. This, however, is its weakest feature. Do not expect the same results you would get from a digital camera or digital webcam. (I could have lived with a model that has no camera.) The other differences are minor (e.g., the automatic turn on/turn off feature). For me, the iPad 2 is a better product for what I needed (reading and surfing the net).

My wife's iPhone 4S was having problems the other day, so I called Apple Care. I was told that I needed to create an Apple Care account for $29.99, just so I could talk to a customer service rep!.......Are you freaking kidding me?! What kind of costumer service is that?

Since I never had the iPad 1 I'm still learning how to use it, although it is somewhat similar to my 3rd generation iPod touch. The iPad 2 has a lot of nice features built in such as a video/picture camera and FaceTime. What I really don't like about my iPad is that I can't download Adobe or watch shows on Hulu or any other website without paying fees. These are things that I can do on my regular laptop at no extra cost. Apple is forcing the iPad purchasers to use iTunes or to pay extra fees elsewhere. If I had known this from the start I would have returned the iPad and bought a tablet. If you don't like watching videos online or you don't mind paying extra fees then the iPad is great. As for me I am not happy with it.Update 12/28/11: iPad now offers Apps for ABC and TV.com for CBS so I can watch shows from these networks for free and I don't have to purchase them from iTunes. The iPad is still restrictive compared to some tablets, but I'm going to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. iPad is equal or superior to most tablets currently on the market, but I just wish that it wasn't so restrictive in some cases.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's an iPad - It's not a Computer !", "Author": "Wade Arnold \"thecirclesoflife\"", "ReviewID": "R12WZIV424X01R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before you go jumping off into Hightech Hysteria, think about what you want to do with what you might be buying.

If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nothing ground breaking here.", "Author": "Bubba", "ReviewID": "R3C23RDV8I3RHH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Really people? For the money this thing is stripped down. They just now add a forward and back facing camera and everyone is like ooh cool. This feature has been on cell phones forever. It should of been added on the original ipad. Think about it. A cell phone has more features than an ipad. Smartphones now have high resolution front and rear facing cameras with flash, able to use the flash as a flashlight, sd card slots, cable hook up to t.v's, wifi, usb, physical keypads, can download music without proprietary software, and so on. All in one little package. Now don't tell me they don't have room on an ipad to add any features.Yes they made this a little lighter and a little faster. But for the price you can buy a powerful laptop or netbook that will leave the ipad 2 in the dust. And you won't have to pay for proprietary cables or accessories for dowloading your pictures, files, music etc. like the camera kit, which doesn't work for all cameras or memory cards to transfer pictures. And don't forget you have to pay for all the Mac apps. And oh you want a physical keyboard? More money. Wait you better buy a protective case to protect your new investment that probably is adding up to almost a grand now. That's where Apple gets you. You have to buy their proprietary products and services. And they will add features and memory upgrades a little at a time to newer models so you will want the latest features. Just like their ipods and itouches.If you are thinking about replacing a computer with this, then read on. If not, then read elswhere.All that said...if you want to do work on it, consider getting a loaded netbook which is a better value and more powerful, more memory and you don't have to go through the hassle of downloading or uploading to another computer like you would have with an ipad. With a netbook you can just load data onto an sd card or thumb drive if you want to instantly. What if you don't have a computer around with an ipad and you want to transfer some files or pictures onto it or want to just download some files and take it with you on a thumb drive. Oh wait did you remember to bring the cables or adapter with you on top of that? Do you want adapters protuding from your expensive ipad waiting to be bumped and snapped off? Also do you use Windows or Mac? Is your printer cabable of over the air printing? If not then you have to either get a capable printer or transfer the data onto a computer that is hooked up to your printer. If it were not for the touchscreen, would anyone buy an ipad? HECK NO! It would be considered a featurless outdated piece of equipment comparable to something about 10 plus years ago. See where i'm going here. But on the same note, a netbook is not as portable. So weigh out your wants and needs. I ended up getting a netbook after research and playing with them and no regrets because I can do anything on it and it is a spare because the kids take up the other computer. I couldn't of done much with the ipad except surf the web. Example, my wifes work computer crashed and she was working from home. Well luckily she had the netbook because she hooked up the netbook to her lcd monitor and logged into a computer at her work place remotely and kept on working. And I also had the netbook hooked up another time to my flatscreen, an external hard drive, mouse, and an sd card in the slot so I could edit pictures, back them up and print them. I also had an extra usb port to spare where I could of had a phone plugged in to charge at the same time my netbook was charging also. Couldn't of done all this with an ipad let alone charge it at the same time if you had something plugged into it's single proprietary port. Get at least an 11.6 inch netbook if you decide on one and still want functionality and portability. Everything fits on the screen better and not crammmed in. Keep in mind though that some netbooks come with just Windows starter and not a full working edition. If you don't get the full working edition, then the netbook would not be of much use. But oh when I just want to lounge around and surf the web, I wish I had a tablet. But I use my phone for that, lame but it works. Oh yeah, I can tether my phone to the netbook also.Personally I think this is mainly usefull for surfing the web or used as an electronic organizer for someone on the move who has to keep track of a lot of information or carries a clipboard i.e. invoices, work orders, short note taking, etc. or needs visual images out in the field. But to use in place of a real computer, no. You can buy apps. for the ipad to do some work on, but they are not as powerful. So think about what you want or need it for. Ask yourself something like this. Do you need something portable for school where you can do term papers and homework on, or for organizing and socializing? This is not a replacement for a computer if that's what you want. It is a media device with limitations features wise. Also with a netbook you can have a spare battery and swap it out and continue on. With an ipad you have to plug it in and wait for it to charge and it defeats the purpose of mobility doesn't it? Yes you ipad defenders, I know the battery charge lasts pretty long, but there are variables affecting it like what you are running and what if you forgot to plug it in overnight and you don't have time to charge it.I'm not saying a tablet doesn't have it's place because it does. And yes I know that an ipad and a netbook are two different things. But it may not serve your needs so be aware. I can see where an ipad or any other tablet would be more practical or even a no brainer because a clamshell design of a netbook might be just to clunky. I'm just pointing out the lack of features on the ipads. If they only would add a memory card slot or standard usb to make it simple to transfer data or so I can hook up other peripherals. I don't want to pull out cables or turn on my computer and sync it everytime I want to transfer data. But don't hold your breath. They want you to buy another one with more memory if you need more. A memory slot or usb would give you the option of adding more memory of your own. And it won't take you long to fill up the little memory the ipad offers if you like to load media onto it.Size and price should be taken into consideration if you want to use it for entertainment away from home a lot. There are several tablets offered from competitors now and some are less expensive, more features, smaller and lighter and don't use a lot of proprietary cables or software applications or hardware, they have sd slots and or usb also. Something you might want to think about if you like to dowload or upload stuff on the fly and travel light. But it comes down to you to research ask questions and try to get some hands on to \"see what works best for you\". Just don't expect that all the tablets perform the same or offer the same apps. Your not going to get ipad performance or huge selection of apps. to choose from compared to a tablet that costs way less. If you just want it to take on vacation while relaxing next to the pool or to keep kids entertained then a less expensive tablet might fit your needs so you can still enjoy yourself and not have to worry as much about it getting stolen, lost, or broken. As for the ipad, you might be to concerned with it to enjoy yourself or it is just too big and a 7 inch tablet is more convienient. But if you want your cake and eat it too. Take a look at the Asus Transformer and Asus Slider. The transformer has a detatchable keyboard with a mouse pad and battery that extends your battery life, two sd slots, USB ports, and you can adjust the angle of the screen and close it like a netbook. The slider has a keyboard build into the tablet and screen flips up. No mousepad though. But there is a USB port that you can hook up a mouse to if you want. Also with the Asus tablets you can multitask and listen to something in the background while doing something else. With the ipad you can't. The Asus tablets support flash and you are able to watch clips on web pages, whereas the ipad you don't get to watch the clips because most clips are flash. The Asus tablets will fit movies on to the screen better and not have the black bars on the top like on the ipad. People are even getting rid of their ipads to get the Asus. There are also a few tablets out there that run Microsoft Windows. So that was just an example of other opions you have out there. Another thing to think about is that there are a lot of phones running on Android as for tablets also. So there is going to be a lot more compatibility between devices because most of them will run on Android. With Apple your limited with their products and don't have other outside options. The tide will turn with more offerings for Android because it will become main stream because most devices and manufacturers now are adapting the Android platform,while the \"I\" line of products are only exclusive to Apple. Will be like the Beta max vs VHS. Beta had better quality but most manufacturers adapted the VHS format instead of Beta. Well Beta died because everyone was making VHS products.Don't slam me if your an ipad lover. It's just things to think about. Don't know why people get so defensive about negative reviews about this thing. They must be the ones replacing their old Apple stuff with the newer models that have the newest inovation (cough, cough). What's new for next year? A flash for the camera? Or wait, maybe a phone feature. That way you can get rid of your cell phone and only carry the ipad around and not have to carry both. There are a lot of fan boys out there defending the ipad with not much to back it up and they take it personal. I think they are in denial and trying to justify their purchase. Well people you are the ones Apple preys on and you fall for it.Update: I finally broke down and got an Acer 7 inch A100 tablet for my daughter for Christmas. And after using it for a while, I will still stand by what said about the limitations and uses of a tablet. And the Acer A100 is only 7 inches perfect size for holding for long periods of time or for traveling instead of a bulky 10 inch. it can keep up with the ipad2 and has ports for micro sd, micro usb, micro HDMI, and hey even a flash for one of the two cameras. Hear that? A simple flash for the camera. Oooh...Oh wait, the ipad3 might get that, can't wait, it will make it the best ipad ever.

Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  But the devices' popularity is growing; indeed I am seeing them everywhere.  Just yesterday I sat next to a woman at my local Ford dealership who was reading a book on her iPad even as I held a text message conversion with a good friend while reading the news from CNN and NPR.For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the Apple iPad does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?  And since buy my iPad in the Fall of last year, the uses for the device have grown tenfold, until now, it is almost indispensable.Now Apple has released the iPad 2 and those of us who use the original are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  Since this new one was for the business I work for I decided to do a one for one replacement of the one I already used for testing purposes; in other words I ordered an \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G\" version.The \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi /3G\" FactsOn the surface the iPad 2 is not demonstratively different from the iPad Original.  Featuring a Dual-core (Apple designed) 1 GHz A5 processor, the 1.33 pound (1.34 pounds for the 3G) iPad 2 is notably thinner than the iPad Original, though the screen size stays the same.  The other big changes: two camera, one rear facing, the other front facing now ship standard with all models; and the graphics are reportedly 9 times as fast.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi/3G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/ 3G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5\" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The \"iPad 2\" (also available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G: UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.  A 4G model of the iPad2 has not been announced.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 2 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (720p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.New Apps that ship with the iPad 2 include FaceTime a real-time video chat application that allows you to calls someone else's iPad 2, iPhone 4, new iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi and establish a video chat session.  The App will not work via 3G.  The other new App is Photo Booth an application that allows you to take pictures of yourself with various effects.Audio playback response frequency is 20Hz - 20,000Hz and the iPad 2 supports the following audio formats:o  HE-AAC (V1)o  AAC (16 to 320 Kbps)o  Protected AAC (from iTunes Store)o  MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps)o  MP3 VBRo  Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4)o  Apple Losslesso  AIFFo  WAVThe iPad can view the following document types:o  Images (.jpg, .tiff, .gif);o  Documents (.doc and .docx (Microsoft Word), .txt, .pdf, .rtf);o  Web pages (.htm and .html);o  Keynote (.key);o  Numbers (.numbers);o  Pages (.pages);o  PowerPoint (.ppt and .pptx)o  Outlook Contacts (.vcf);o  Excel (.xls and .xlsx)Re-syncing with iTunesThe iPad 2 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 2 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 1 showed up on my iPad 2, sans the folders I had set up to group Apps in.Transferring My AT&T; 3G AccountAll of the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G devices I have purchased thus far use AT&T; for their 3G service.  There are two plans at the time of this review: $14.99 for 250MB a month data package and $25.00 for 2GB date package.A funny thing happened along the way to transferring my current 3G plan to my new iPad 2: AT&T; killed (deactivated) the removable SIM card in the iPad 1.  They claim they needed to, but I'm not so sure, because it makes no sense to me.  Another (micro) SIM card can be obtained from the nearest AT&T; store for free, though so stores may charge you $15.00, so check around.  Once the new SIM is inserted into the iPad 1 you can set-up and activate the 3G service on the device.Note: unused data package byte (for lack of a better term), cannot be rolled over from month-to-month.  Conversely, if your plan minutes run out during the month AT&T; will not automatically anoint you with more; more minutes can be purchased from the iPad 2, but it is a manual process.  However, the package will be renewed at the end of the 30 days, and continue to renew every 30 days unless stopped.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  The iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to \"Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.\"VPN AccessThe iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G VPN can be togged on and off at will.First Impressions:Like my personal iPad 1, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have been testing.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business e-mail.Today while was waiting in line (yes I said line) for my dealership to open up so I could get me car serviced, I brook out my iPad 2 and started watch videos on Vevo; now how cool is that?Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I bought the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 3G and, instance access.ConclusionsLike the iPad 1 before it the iPad 2 is the must have device of the decade, period!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99).  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.  Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office.  As it stands now any document you want to work with must be e-mailed and then opened.  However, the iPad was never marketed as a laptop, or laptop replacement, so...Not that these problems cannot be overcome, but they are limitation that a laptop and even netbooks do not suffer from.  However, hands down, the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (799.00) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain \"cool\" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "ipad", "Author": "golfjunkie", "ReviewID": "R31IWMBWFQG0Q4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "just got it and am learning the ins and out of. due to have knee surgery soon and will be laid up for a while.

At the time, I really felt like I was \"biting the bullet.\"  I guess I just didn't think I would totally harness it's capabilities and only use it \"casually\" to write the occasional e-mail and surf the web.  To that end, I was right but as far as iPad generations are concerned, this device hits the sweet spot for what I use the tablet for (surfing the web, typing posts on Amazon, Tweeting and the occasional e-mail).  It's not too powerful for gaming per se but offers a silky smooth performance for business related functionality.  I even find that I don't need a BlueTooth keyboard as typing on it's screen in landscape mode is fast and easy enough.The only disappointment I have is that I paid for the cellular antenna.  I find that I mostly use this device in the home as a quick means of accessing the Internet where a WiFi access point is readily available.  I also take it with me out-of-town and for the most part, most hotels offer free WiFi so the cellular aspect of this device was money wasted.I am EXTREMELY pleased with this device's battery life.  It has been tested and found that the iPad 2 has the longest battery life of ALL the iPad generations up through the iPad 4 or \"iPad with Retina Display!\"  I truly believe this iPad second generation is the \"sweet spot\" in Apple's iPad lineup and that is why the Cupertino company is continuing to offer this device for purchase.  You don't really need the \"retina\" screen or the extra 500mb of memory for business tasks such as surfing the web or writing an e-mail.  This device will work flawlessly for those tasks.I can only express how happy I am that I purchased this tablet.  I will probably upgrade to the next iPad 5th generation, if it offers the robust WiFi AC and comes in an even slimmer, more elegant form factor.  I would recommend that users opt out of getting the cellular model unless they need to use the device in their cars for example.

The iPad has Bluetooth capabilities and I bought a Bluetooth keyboard to go with the iPad. I am still wrapping my head around the iPad and all its features. I really enjoy the iCloud, allowing me to sync up my iPhone and iPad. One of the first apps I downloaded was Pages and it has been fantastic. One of my biggest concerns regarding the iPad is the accessibility to remove documents, pictures,etc off of the iPad. There is no USB port, so I cannot hook up a zip-drive and due to the age of my Mac, I cannot download the iCloud app. So my only options are to email it to myself or go on my computer, go to the iCloud website, sign-on and get the document that way. When I brought this up to the Apple worker, he stated that the iPad is capable of printing directly from the iPad as an option as well. So that minimized my concerns.

I am currently a college student with plans to teach at the high school level, so I knew there would be endless amount of apps that will enhance my teaching in the future.  Right now, schools are exploring 1 on 1 iPads with their students because it makes it so much easier to grade and create assignments without the hassle of textbooks.  At home, I became sick of pulling out my four-year old Dell laptop to surf the web, watch videos, and just play around.  I wanted something that was smaller, easy to travel with, and it had to be a tablet.  Now, my Dell is fine for writing papers and all the other obligations that come with being a college student, but for an apple product as efficient and productive as the iPad, the price is tough to beat.  The iPad does not replace a desktop or a laptop, but it is a tremendous technological device that is user friendly and fun to play with.  Whether it is for leisure or work, there is an application for it.  What I like the most is that the ios apple system signals to the iPad when it is time for an update, making it up to par with the latest technology, which in turn betters its efficiency and productivity instantly.  With that being said, the ability to access the apple store is what sets it apart from other tablets.  Like I previously stated, there are apps for everything, and there are even several free apps that increase enjoyment and productivity.  It is a must buy for anyone interested in a tablet for both leisure and work obligations.I also have an iPhone 4 which I use very religiously, and the iPad 2 is an extension of that for me.  There are fewer apps available for the iPad, but that's not saying a lot, as there are still thousands available for it, as I find myself searching for a new app daily on the apple store.I have the 32GB edition and have not come close to filling up all the storage space!  I think it is the perfect size for somebody that doesn't constantly use it, but for someone that is on it daily at work or at home.  If you are going to count on it for everything you do in regards to a computer device, I would recommend the 64GB, but for me the 32GB has been great and I have not run into any problems to this point.  In addition, the device is very light, and you can hold it with one hand.  Definitely buy a protective case for your iPad, even though I have found it to be very durable.It is very nice to be able to use it like a mini computer.  You can access your personal files via google drive, drop box, etc. to increase productivity and bring your desktop or laptop files on the road with you.  One nice feature is that you can view websites with a mobile display or desktop display, serving for the benefit of all users.  Powerpoints, Word Documents, and PDF's are easy to view with the tap of the finger, which is very beneficial for someone in the business world or still in school.While I thoroughly enjoy my iPad 2, there are frustrations with it.  I find myself frustrated with the fact that I can't play Flash.  I like to watch videos, especially via twitter and facebook, and a lot of times I am unable to do so because of the software's inability to play flash.  In addition, I get frustrated because I wish I could make the iPad my only source of a computer.  I wish I could type on word and make a powerpoint as seamless as I do on my Dell.  I could do that, but on a college budget you don't want to be paying for an expensive app to make that a reality, but that's also the beauty of it.  You could download Microsoft Office products if you wanted to make it your go-to computer device.  One thing I would suggest is buying a keyboard for your iPad.  I went a year without one, but once I acquired a keyboard it made it that much more efficient to use!  So much easier to surf the web, iMessage, etc.In essence, if you're having a tough time deciding on buying an iPad or not, I would highly suggest buying one.  Now, if it is between a MAC laptop and an iPad, go with the laptop.  But, if you are in the market for a tablet and are looking for efficiency and productivity with a tablet, the iPad is a much because of the apple IOS software and the thousands of applications available via the apple store.  The slick design with endless amount of possibilities to increase production with an iPad puts it a head above the rest.  Once you begin using an iPad, you won't regret the purchase.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderfully limited", "Author": "D. Adams", "ReviewID": "R38DNSHOAQXTDT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I swore up and down I'd NEVER purchase an apple product, including things on itunes and the like.  So far, I have upheld that promise.  However, from a recent car purchase, I managed to obtain an iPad 2 16GB as a promotion.  Since my girlfriend had one and I did want some experience with iOS, I figured I'd begin poking around with it rather than simply selling it.The good...iOS is very easy to use and extremely straight forward.  Everything is laid out nicely and always a flick-tap away.  And most all programs work very well with the unit.  Software tends to be clean without too many bugs.Web browsing (just using Safari) is very smooth.  Most sites work well.  There's the ocational hiccup but it's more from using a touchscreen or the dreaded lack of Flash.  But soon enough, sites will probably migrate away from flash and on towards HTML5 (or simply pages designed for mobile/iPads).Usability, such as typing is very straight forward.  The keyboard is well thought out and works much better than any I've used.  The touchscreen is very responsive too and multi-touch works without a problem.Standby time is awesome and the unit is still functioning (IE gives you push notifications of Skype/AIM/etc)Given the standpoint of say someone's who's very unfamiliar with technology or who doesn't care to spend time \"configuring things\", this works great.  However, that is not who I am...The bad...You are extremely limited.  Being closed source, some apps simply are not available as they would be for Android or Windows-based tablets (and I mean x86, not Windows 8 RT)  Finding ways to print can be impossible, certain formats may be unreadable, and even simple things such as adding attachments in gmail may be hindered without installing additional apps.No Flash support!!!  As mentioned above, things are moving away from flash.  However, many sites still use flash there for some sites will not display correctly.  You are also limited on sites like Youtube, sometimes being unable to open the same videos you can open on a desktop environment (or even Android devices).Where are my files?!  Stuff just downloads.  You have no choice where to put them.  Download something you don't want to share then start browsing the photos you took using the camera, SURPRISE!Limited connectivity.  Expansion is limited to the propriatary apple plug on the bottom.  No OTG port, no standard USB, no microSD slot, no HDMI.

Instead I want to share my experiences living with the iPad 2 for about a year now.The main use for this device has been web surfing while sitting on the couch in front of the TV.  There's no doubt that we're moving to a multi-screen world and it's nice to be able to look something up on IMDB.com when watching something on TV or to check your email during a commercial break while watching a ballgame.  It is not my main web surfing machine, I don't have the best eyes and I'm addicted to my 24\" screen on my desktop, but the iPad does nicely for light web use.As an e-reader the iPad 2 isn't horrible, it's just nowhere near as good as a Kindle which means the only things that really get read on the iPad are books I have in PDF files, such as a Photoshop manual where having a nice color display really helps.  We've read some magazines on it, but the screen is really too small to make the a comfortable experience for me.  Your mileage may vary here as some people I know love reading magazines on an iPad.  For me, that experience will be better when there is an iPad that has about a 12\" screen size.One thing the iPad is really good at is playing videos.  With streaming apps getting better and better, like the HBO GO app, it's making the iPad more and more useful.  It's nice to be able to take your content anywhere you want in the house.  The screen is absolutely beautiful for playing video content, and once again for extended viewing I'd like a screen that's just a tad bigger than this current one.The performance of the iPad 2 is very nice, everything feels snappy and I've really never felt like the processor was being bogged down while using it.  It feels very nice in the hand and is very sturdy.There is no doubt about it, tablets are useful and they're entertaining but I don't see them ever replacing desktops or laptops for me.  I do a lot of design work though, so my needs are different than most people.  If you're looking for something to check email, surf the web and catch some video content then the iPad will be perfect for those needs.The bottom line is if you're going to get a tablet it's still hard to beat an iPad.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad 2 WiFi", "Author": "baydogs", "ReviewID": "RSDSQK2UZUWTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never had Apple products except for an iPod.

I can not walk around holding it all day, so pretty much I have to leave it at home. When I am at home, I have a computer in just about every room, so really dont know what I need the ipad for. It does not really do anything that a computer does not already do.When I travel, space in the carry on bag is a premium. I tried travelling once with this, and leaving the laptop at home, and it was a disaster. It will handle routine email, but if you need to edit a document, or interact with a web site that has flash, you are out of luck. I went to Africa with this instead of a laptop, and ended up on the phone for long periods trying to get someone back in the states to handle the business items I could not do on the ipad. So, when I travel if I already have to take an iphone and a laptop, what niche does the ipad fill?In optimizing my carry on for travel, I take an iphone, a small laptop, a good Sony camcorder, and the canon powershot elph.

The screen for movies and tv shows was fantastic though the wifi connection would keep dropping in the middle of streaming. The more I used the Fire the more I realized that it wasn't able to give me what I wanted.  It did not have a large enough amount of device itself storage space,I could not turn the backlight down low enough to make it comfortable for me to read, I could not download the BN reading app to read my BN book library, and the screen really wasn't large enough to comfortably browse the internet or read magazines.  I started looking at the Ipad 2 and after what I saw from a co-worker's IPAD I gifted my Fire to my sister and bought my own Ipad.  I absolutely love it!  It has given me everything that I wanted - most specifically the fact that I can have the Amazon reading apps and BN reading app on the device and can read both bookstore's library on the same device.  I had purchased the 16 mb but two days later upgraded to the 64 mb.  The backlight can be turned down to being almost off, browsing is great, reading my emails is easier now. The wifi connection is solid up in my room where the Fire would keep dropping the connection. I am amazed at how much you can do with this device with the different apps.  It is always with me!  True it is heavier than the Fire - it's more like reading a hardback book, but the print is big and the backlight is softer on the eyes.  Also true is the fact that I now cannot watch the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows, but ITunes has a lot to offer even though you have to pay for it.  Small trade-off in my opinion since I am mostly a book person - not a movie person.  Now if Amazon were to make a bigger Fire and take care of some of the issues I mentioned above - the Fire could definitely give the IPAD a run especially having the Instant Prime Video behind them but for now I would recommend the IPAD 2 over the Kindle Fire.  p.s.

Then Apple sold 15 million of them in just nine months, creating a whole new category of technology product. The iPad may have become, in the words of Steve Jobs, \"the most successful consumer product ever launched.\"It turns out that a lot of people saw the iPad's appeal: it's a supremely portable device that's well suited for checking your e-mail, surfing the Web, playing games, reading books and other stuff you get off the Internet, and even for getting work done. Kids and the elderly have embraced it.It's awfully hard to follow such a massive success, but that's the task set out for Apple's new iPad 2, which goes on sale Friday. At least the iPad 2 has this going for it: the original model caught the technology industry so flat-footed that only now are true competitors beginning to appear.Those competitors will now face a new iteration of the iPad, one that's faster, smaller, and lighter than the model introduced a year ago--all while retaining the $499 entry price that has proven all but impossible for Apple's competitors to match. It's almost unfair.A game of inches (and ounces)Call it Jobs's Law if you like: The latest version of any Apple product is likely to be thinner and lighter than its predecessor. And so it is with the iPad 2. The size difference between the original iPad and the iPad 2 may seem slight, but that's only because we're dealing with such small products to begin with. But for products this small, every ounce and fraction of an inch counts.The iPad 2 measures 7.31 by 9.5 by 0.34 inches, and weighs in at 1.33 pounds (in the case of the Wi-Fi-only version, that is--the AT&T; and Verizon 3G versions are .01 and .02 pound heavier). That means Apple shaved .17 pound off the Wi-Fi version and .26 to .27 pound off the 3G version. The iPad 2 is also .16 inch narrower, .06 inch shorter, and .16 inch thinner than the original iPad.A matter of small degrees, to be sure, until you consider the percentage change: the iPad 2 is roughly two-thirds the thickness of the original iPad, and 88 percent of its weight (83 percent when comparing 3G models). Pick up an iPad 2 after handling an original iPad, and you'll notice the difference right away.

Original iPad was my first one, which was bought as a gift for my friend and accidentally became a good entertainment for me and my wife. It's a great product, one of a very few gadgets I find myself truly love to use and feel the convenience and ease of use that rarely comes with a product that is sophisticated in its functionality and simple in its design. The reason I talk about my iPad in a iPad 2 review is that I want to give you a perspective of how I loved my iPad and all the good things about iPad has been improved and perfected, either in a subtle or substantive way, in iPad 2. The most obvious change I sensed were two things, a significant reduce in weight and a increase in processing speed. I have frequently found myself looking for iPad 2 at home to have a google search job done even though iPad is up front of my eyes.Another thing I came to appreciate both iPad and iPad 2 is their intuitive user interface. Quite opposite to a technology geek as I am, my mom has no knowledge in what an operating system is and has no idea how her order is fulfilled by a computing device, be it a pc or whatever else. This makes it very hard to explain to her how she should interact with the interface of an operating system. To her, opening up an application on a Windows desktop, in the start menu and Notification area are fundamentally different actions that take conceptually distinctive approaches to accomplish. Such understanding and confusion in opening different application have soon disappeared after only a few practices with the iPad home button.

The experience is much more enjoyable over all.  This is a non-biased review, I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 as well (I may even be more of a fanboy toward Samsung, owning a 3d Blu ray player, 3D Led and LCD tv).  In my opinion, what makes the Ipad better than any of the Android tablets is the apps.  Apples app store has more apps than the Android market has to offer.  The Apple app store is also better looking and more organized (Android is getting better though).  Everything is clearly labeled for what device ie Ipad or Iphone/Itouch.  On the Android market its hard to tell whats what.  I have downloaded many apps that are intended for a phone.  I downloaded Guitar Hero 5 from the Android market and playing it was unbearable due to the tiny screen size, there was no option to enlarge the screen (Android needs to do a software update for this asap).  If you have a favorite Itouch game that you wanted to play on a bigger screen you can with the Ipad, you can increase the screen size).  In my opinion developers of apps are clearly making them first on Ipad.  For example, Netflix, Face Book, Onlive, and Boxee.  I would love to have a offical Face Book app for my Galaxy Tab. There is a Face Book app for Android but its ment for a phone and looks terrible on a tablet.  Why does it take so long for android to get them?  Even similar apps for both apple and android look better on Ipad, words with friends and Amazon Shopping app for starters!  Amazon you NEED to give Android the same app you gave Apple!  The one on my GT sucks.  Apple even has more demos of games...there usually called something like lite or free.  Apple has airplay which is cool if you own a AppleTV, I can play Angry Birds on my Samsung 3D LED 55 inch TV!  Yes Samsung has AllShare (Samsungs version of AirPlay) but for some stupid reason the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 doesnt have that app!  Why in the world does the first generation have it but the new one doesnt?  You cant even download it off the Samsung App store, maybe its coming w/Ice Cream Sandwich??  Heres basically my pros and cons for the Ipad:ProsEasy to useTons of Apps and better looking onesAirplayWay more accessaries and Cases (Im still waiting for a OtterBox case for my GT)ConsNo flashVery controlled device and you cant customize it like AndroidHeres a couple of things that I like better on the Galaxy tab.  On paper the GTs specs are better than Ipad 2.  You can customize it just about any way you want...but you need to be a lil tech savy.  Just about every game on Android is free and and they are full games (with ads)  Everyday Amazon gives you a free app!There is more than one market place to shop from (Android Market, Amazon, Samsung etc.)  Youtube looks cooler on Android...love the 3d honey comb looks!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "T.

Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.As far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.It does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.There is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.The cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.There is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.Apple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.If you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad IOS 7", "Author": "Hong", "ReviewID": "R2O5VO42TUI06K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My IPAD2 was good when I used IOS6.

I've dropped my iPad 2 on the same floor maybe 2x. It got a tiny dent in the aluminum frame. I have dropped this iPad on wood floors, ceramic tile, stone tile, concrete, asphalt, you name it (yes, grass, too). I do not, nor have I ever, had a case on it. Sure, the edges of the case are dented beyond repair, but the screen and (surprisingly) the back of the frame are scuff-free.BUT!!! However you drop it, DO NOT drop anything on it! My TV remote slipped from my hand less than 1 foot above my screen, and it obliterated the home button, which I now keep in my pocket. I found it extremely ironic :)The screen is impossible to scratch, however. Not gouge, but scratch. Since it's broken, I ordered a new screen. I decided to see how tough the screens are by scratching one with a nail (as in hammer and nail, not finger nail). It could not scratch it. Since I don't remember much of the Mohs Hardness scale, and I lack a diamond, it's somewhere between a 3 and 10 hardness.- Personalization .1/5Apple has too much restricted customer customization of this product. As soon as you get this product, JAILBREAK IT! Jailbreaks are not illegal unless you install illegal sources. If you don't like any aspect of Apple's software designs, from there being a six-icon limit on the dock, to being able to run all your applications in windows or have Siri on the iPad, Jailbreak it. 99.9382% of the time you'll find the tweak you're looking for.- Size 2.3/5Frankly, 2 years ago when I was 13 I was flipping out to get such a big electronic toy. Now I think it's too freaking big. If you want a size that is good for presentations, yet still retaining good mobility, go with an iPad. If you want something you can stick in you're jacket pocket yet still be able to read, get something nearby the size of a Kindle Fire, even though I personally think iPad is 700x better.- Battery Life 5/5...I sometimes sit there and watch the battery drain, because I'm afraid if I open an app it will die (obviously this is at maybe 5-30% battery life). Yet sometimes I've found I can play for 4-5 hours, on a 3D game, no less, from 100% to dead.- Display ...The part we've all been waiting for...Honestly, I'd have to say... 4.6/5I thought the display was absolutely stunning. That is, until I saw the iPad 3. I started seeing minor (MINOR!!!!!!) flaws on edges. This was mostly in a few particular apps designed for both iPhone and iPad, most of the other apps were just fine.If you don't mind not having 3,100,000 pixels, take 786,432 pixels instead. You won't notice a difference, so long as you avoid iPad 3's.- Versatility 5/5I use this for school, homework, games, browsing the web to buy a new screen, FaceTiming with friends, staying up-to-date with friends, you name it.

The iPad's various styli, with their resistant, rubbery \"nubs,\" still leave much to be desired).  Yet, overall there would appear to be few if any viable alternatives at this stage.  Apple was first to the parade and, according to practically every review of the latest model (including that most popular consumer's magazine), continues to remain in the top position.The primary advantage of the Apple 2--from my perspective--would appear to be the lighter weight and more compact size.  Personally, I found the iPad 1 to be hot and heavy compared to my Air 11\", which I now use for practically all of my computing.  So be sure to take note of screen size and overall weight of any other device you may be considering before ordering.  Also, note that the highest-rated tablet on Amazon (the Toshiba) has yet to be released!  If you're considering it, it would seem overly hasty if not reckless not to wait for it to \"test out\" on the market for a few months.As for the iPad, the Flash controversy proved a non-issue for my wife and me.  The lack of certain ports--for HDMI, USB, display, etc.--was never anything that couldn't be addressed and fixed with a readily available adapter.  Finally, look for any other machine that comes close to the iPad in terms of the galaxy of available \"apps.\"  The lack of a keyboard (true of most any tablet) can also be addressed--but now we're getting close to a Macbook Air, which strikes me as the more practical purchase in the first place.In short, there's every reason to spring for another iPad (if you like the concept in the first place) and a number of reasons to withhold purchase of any other brand.  But a caveat: this is one of the few times that I've found a product sold through Amazon to be significantly higher in cost, even without sales tax, than the same product purchased through Apple Store.[As a musician, I've found a reason to like this device: it can be loaded up with musical scores (several life-times' worth) and set on a stand or piano ledger, the equivalent of a giant-sized cabinet full of notated music contained within a thin, easily readable and navigable tablet.]", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big money for corporate giants", "Author": "felipe echevarria \"Felipe Echevarria\"", "ReviewID": "RZ8UCID1546VC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just bought a brand new 16GB iPad2 off Craigslist, and have some general comments...I found it quite difficult to get set up, it seems you have to connect the iPad to a PC or Mac and go from there (you get no manual, just a stupid little card with minimal info on it), which meant lots of figuring things out. Just the iTunes image alone that first appears on the screen when turning it on for the first time makes you go \"huh?\"  Maybe the Jr. High kids can blast through it, but it's harder for me (I'm 52) and I have a fair amount of computer experience.You also have to input your credit card info! This means one thing...this machine is designed purposely to be a money hog for Apple and entertainment giants. It will have you buying all kinds of apps and music and entertainment to download from iTunes. Another step closer to being an automaton.No USB port means Apple wants to control accessories and what you can input/output with the iPad, and that leaves you guessing, finding workarounds, and buying more stuff. But sure, it's also to minimize complications with external devices.This machine is amazing, though, I got it for showing my work and upcoming interactive apps at conventions (I'm an artist). I can now carry around a portfolio of my work without the bulk. But to get photos on it properly you will have to buy an application for it. There are ways of getting photos uploaded without iTunes and buying photo apps (like emailing them to yourself and downloading them from there), but then the photo app it comes with leaves you without much capability to manipulate and organize them and put them in folders. There are literally no buttons/selections to control things with. This is obviously another manipulation to make you buy something more.Lastly, if you want accessories (or even the iPad itself), go to Amazon or Craigslist, Ebay, friends, family--and buy them used, don't fork out $50 for a new protective cover, you can find a lot of these things used or cheaper than buying from Apple or manufacturers that don't care about the Earth and design products that end up too soon in the landfill.Overall it's a cool machine, but like me, with the way corporations/manufacturers plan and manipulate your pocketbook you might one day start to realize you're just a cog in the money machine for these corporate entities.Well, someone had to say it.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great when it works", "Author": "Darrell E.

I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Evolutionary not revolutionary...but that was expected", "Author": "Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"", "ReviewID": "RVXU4HZNUZ5MB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So after picking it up Friday and playing around with it most of the weekend, what's the final word? Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.As far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.It does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.There is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.The cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.There is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.Apple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.If you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Hate Apple with a Passion", "Author": "chunkeeone", "ReviewID": "R1HEIGA05U9X3V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my iPad 2 and loved it for a few months. Take note that I am severe o.c.d. here, therefore, there is absolutely no way it got wet or dropped or any other sort of freak accident occurred on my part to hurt it, as suggested by every single troubleshooter out there. It started ghostwriting and not responding correctly to where it was being touched... So I checked out my warranty situation and of course, being that it was a present that was bought months previous to my taking ownership of it (via a belated birthday gift) but never taken out of the box, not that that matters to Apple, I was told I would have to pay full price to replace the touch sensor which I found out recently is such a serious problem with Apple that they (if they cared about their consumers, that is) should have recalled it long ago.. I am already tired of talking about this. I am just getting angry about it again...I had the same sort of problem when I received an iPod shuffle for an Xmas gift years before.... The people I know with Apple computers can rarely read discs I send them and the friends I have with iPhones have all switched back to droid types...I do not know why this brand is so popular but I will never buy from them.

PC's all my life and i knew nothing about apple products except that they were expensive and the most pretentious people liked them. and i stand by that.well.....lets just say that the iPad 2 is just a amazing little machine. it took me awhile to figure out the whole system...it is different from a PC and not google-based. it is a transition...if your like me i can tell you honestly its a transition you would do well for yourself by taking.i am gonna compare the Xoom to the iPad 2 because it might be helpful and when i made my purchase i noticed alot of reviewers did the same...1- looks. iPad.its stunning. absolutely gorgeous. its art. no doubt. the Xoom is cool indeed, but the iPad has it hands down. dont mind paying more for that at all. you live once.2- speed. its incredibly fast. insane. and gotta give it up to the Xoom too...when it was running at full speed it was incredible too. both equal in my opinion.3- ease of use. Xoom has it all over the iPad 2. coming from PC's its a seamless transfer. google-based. tabs. etc...no worries. the iPad is completely new so the challenge is teaching yourself...BUT once you learn the way...MY GOD IT IS AWESOME.4- accessories and apps. iPad. all the way. no doubt. none. the apps are incredible. the accessories are ridiculously expensive for what they are but once you hold them...the quality is there. the Xoom has no real acessories to speak of..and the apps available are few and far between. that said...i didnt have any problem with normal use of the Xoom and i understand more are on the way...which is awesome.5- battery life. same. both rock. ten hours.6- screen. iPad 2. hands down. amazing and beautiful. the screen doesn't get nearly the amount of fingerprints as the xoom and the pictures are gorgeous. this is a non-issue. the iPad looks better in every way.7- ease of use. Xoom. really easy to use. intuitive.8- support. iPad. AppleCare is the best thing ever. ever. forget about it.9- photos. Xoom. the ability to store photos into catagories and switch them around is awesome. the iPad you just have one big place to put all of your pics.that said 10- cameras. iPad.11 - cost. about the same. iPad maybe more with the applecare.and finally...12- set up. Xoom. all the way. plug it up and your good to go. the iPad you gotta sync with a PC and load up iTunes and jump a bunch of annoying hoops. that done though...MAN is it awesome.sooo....its a big purchase. i think both machines will do right by anyone. but if your looking for something artistic. dramatic. tough and secure go for the iPad. if your looking for something familar, comfortable and easy...the Xoom is for you.in conclusion....my iPad 2 is awesome. im glad i took the plunge and have no regrets. every day im loving it more and more...its amazing.im becoming pretentious now. i find myself silently judging others by their tablets and computers. i do and its awful. if you choose to get a iPad you will do the same thing. you need to be prepared for it....its a glorious feeling!!!!!

Whether you are at home and just want to play games or watch Netflix or if you are at school and want to take notes, this Ipad can do just about anything. Many people have consumed and reported their personal experiences and for the most part if you own an Ipad 2 you cooler than everyone else who doesn\u2019t own one. People will look at you at work or in class and envy you since they don\u2019t have one. That is a fact! I encourage everyone to own one of these. It is a purchase I do not regret and I would recommend it to anyone. My whole family owns one from my sister to my cousins and nephews and we are all satisfied with the Ipad 2. It works as a mini computer on the go and you will love it. This item is fun to use and is very appealing. The size and weight of it allows you to be able to take anywhere with you. It is much thinner and it has been created to be much faster than other tablets. You will not have to wait for 10 minutes to allow it to turn on , you will be guaranteed fast service from this apple product. There are also multiple languages from which you can choose from to The display of the Ipad is just phenomenal. It\u2019s glossy widescreen allows you to see everything very nicely. There\u2019s no doubt the resolution quality is the best! You would want to take pictures and videos everywhere you go. This Ipad has also been created with front and rear cameras so you don\u2019t have to only take pictures of others but you can take pictures of yourself. How awesome! So if you and your friend want to take a picture but there is no one around that can do you the favor, there is no need to worry about it because you have this ipad. Adjust the camera to face you and snap away. You can also fix the picture by adding filters or purchasing apps that allow you to fix a picture in anyway whether its adjusting the color and brightness or adding funny stickers or borders. There are thousands of apps you can find that are fun and very useful. Many apps you must pay for but they are usually very cheap and definitely worth it. There are also many free apps that are your usual apps. The app store has thousands of apps specifically for ipads. This allows you to have an enjoyable time when using your ipad. When purchasing your ipad, your item comes with free built in apps. These apps include the camera, calendar, clock, safari and many more general apps you need on a everyday basis. Surfing the web on your Ipad can not get any easier. It was created so that everyone can easily learn from your 4 year old sister to your 70 year old grandmother. The buttons on the exterior of the ipad include the home, volume, and silence key and the hold button. The power and battery life of the ipad is excellent. You can go hours of surfing the web or playing games without having to keep charging it everyday.  For example, I recently went on a trip to San Francisco which took 6 hours. I watched movies on the way there and movies on the way back and didnt have to chrage it during my vacation. It was amazing to be able to use it for so long and not have to keep charging it on my trip. On my trip I was also able to factime my brother who was back at home. With the ipad you can videochat and factime anyone at anytime as long as you have wifi. This allows you to have contact with someone you havent seen for a while. It allows you to be able to see someone while talking to them at the same time. This for me is the best part of the ipad since It clearly allows me to see my brother who lives far away from me. The Apple Ipad 2 is an excellent product overall. If you are still debating whether or not to purchase an Ipad 2 you should go and play with one hands on first before purchasing.

This means that when you get a map of where you are going later, you can take a screen shot that will go right to your photos (camera roll) and then you can go there and email or text it to anyone else so they have a map to meet you there! You can do this with anything on your screen!!!! What a fantastic tool!Another thing I love that people don't often know about is in the settings, general, accessibility section there are two things you can just turn on and they will read you almost anything out loud on your iPad!  One of them was created for differently abled people and one is more basic.  Speak over and Auto Text are the ones to look for respectively if you'd like to try these! They do take some getting used to.One other thing I learned late in my use of this is that when you are looking at emails, you do not have to open them before deleting them.

Having had one now for five days, I can't imagine life without one.  I haven't even booted up my laptop since getting it. Granted, I took advantage of the price drop since the release of the 3 but after consulting with several experts informing me that the 2 would be a wise purchase at the lessor price I took the plunge. I'm delighted I did.I will not get into technical jargon, but what pleasure this product makes computing. At this point, I know that I have barely scratched the surface. It's extremely intuitive and quick. I thought I might have difficulty with the keyboard, but the keys are large enough and respond nicely when touched. Video streams efficiently and I like how quickly the screen self-adjusts from vertical to horizontal and back again. The images are crystal clear and the camera takes great pictures.I do have an issue and it is a common one with many people that have the IPad, it does not support Flash. Many of the things I do on the net and job-wise use Flash, so I will have to use other devices if an activity uses it. I also own a Kindle Fire and I like it too. Comparatively, the IPad does so much more, but it does come at a higher price. If you just want to be able to do basic web browsing, reading, and watch movies, the Fire is great.

Goulian", "ReviewID": "R2AO4MUOPGPZWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning a Kindle 3 for a year, then a Kindle Fire for 6 months, I am now the proud owner of an iPad 2. I am also in a position to compare the two tablets without any bias at all.First, why the switch? The Kindle Fire is a great tablet, much better than the Kindle 3 in my opinion because of the apps, the small size, the backlit screen, and the Silk browser. And for many months now I have compared the iPad at a distance to the Kindle Fire, and I kept coming back with \"why would I want to spend $500 on an iPad when I can get a Fire for $200? I already own a laptop. Why would I need so much functionality in an eBook reader?  The iPad solves a problem that I do not have.\"But the advantages of the iPad only become apparent once you own one. That's when the large screen makes you realize how much you squinted at the Fire's smaller screen. How much smoother the Safari browser works than the Silk browser. And how much better the selection of apps are on the iPad.So, once the new iPad came out and the iPad 2 price dropped by $100, I found myself thinking seriously about it. And before I knew it, I had one. And I like it. I like it a lot.Now, I am still a huge Amazon fan and have no intention of leaving Amazon, so the thought of reading books and watching Amazon Prime videos on a non-Kindle device filled me with a bit of trepidation. Can it all work as nicely on the iPad as it does on the Kindle Fire? The answer is \"Yes\", with one rather large exception: video. Unfortunately videos (TV shows & movie's) downloaded from Amazon require Adobe Flash which Apple does not support on its mobile devices, so that was my first disappointment. But that's been my only disappointment so far and it turns out that it's not a huge problem at all. All of the other pluses of the iPad make up for that. There is plenty of video for the iPad: it's all on iTunes, and a lot of it is free. The Kindle reader works just fine on the iPad 2, in fact its nicer with the large screen.  Book prices on Amazon and Apple appear to be identical. Although the iPad 2 is larger and heavier than the Fire, it's not that much heavier to be a hindrance and I don't see it being any more difficult to slip into my travel bag. Battery life is about the same. But for sure the apps available on the iPad are a welcome sight compared to the Kindle, in both the quantity and quality. This is really where the scale tips heavily in Apple's favor. Sure, Android has thousands of apps available, but Amazon does not let you have them on the Kindle. You are restricted to only downloading the apps that Amazon has approved for the Kindle Fire, and that turns out to be a disappointingly small number of apps, many of which are of mediocre quality.  I would find myself eagerly searching the Kindle app store for the same apps that I enjoy on the iPhone, only to find that they are simply not available for the Kindle Fire. Apps like Skype, Evernote, TED, PBS,  Dropbox, Voxer, SayHi, WeightWatchers mobile, and plenty more. Another experience that is much better on the iPad is watching the news and documentaries while I walk on my treadmill. The bigger screen is a huge improvement and with all the great apps for news and shows, there truly is no end to what you can watch. Add to all of this the microphone, front & back cameras (I got the Wi-Fi only model), accelerometer, GPS and compass and you now have a much more exciting tablet experience. I also found the Silk browser to be clunky and unresponsive at times on the Fire with tabs & buttons that are small and difficult to press , while iPad's Safari is easier to use and has not even hiccupped. Could it be my wireless router? The distance to the router has not changed, just the tablet, so I call that a Silk issue.So what really changed between the Kindle Fire and the iPad? Me. I thought all I wanted was a good eBook reader and for the last couple of years, the Kindle more than sufficed. But I found out that my needs and expectations have changed and I what I really want now is great tablet. And that's the iPad, hands down.Correction: The wi-fi only model does not have a GPS module, but the location services and digital compass can still show your location for apps that need it. Interestingly, turn-by-turn directions in Mapquest work fine, as long as you have a wifi signal, but unless you have a good wifi signal in your car, GPS is pretty useless.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Mznurse", "ReviewID": "R3VRGKX5KB3PCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have multiple apple items.

So far we are tremendously satisfy and uses it more often than we ever thought we would.The new iPad 2 is slimmer, sleeker, faster, and lighter than it's predecessor while retaining the same display size.  Upgraded with a faster processor, it runs a lot smoother and able to multitask more quickly without getting overheated or apps crashing.  The traditional aluminum back casing makes its return with a sexy sleek taper design.  I always feel the sense of durability and toughness, just an overall very solid constructed piece of work whenever I'm handling it, even when dropped, multiple times.

I learned my lesson to pick and choose what I feel most comfortable using and to not be so stubborn about supporting a company that I dislike.  I should say the only thing I dislike about Apple is their computer operating system.  It's not an operating system for me.  I don't feel comfortable using it and it is definitely much more boring than using a Windows operating system that has a gazillion more software written for it.  I'm a Windows guy, grew up with Windows and dabbled with Linux.  I tried to jump on to Linux band wagon long time ago and attempted to stick to it.  It was after several years that I realized Linux was likely not going ANYWHERE on the consumer side for the foreseeable future.  Linux will always be known as a great server operating system, reliable SAMBA share server, etc, but it will never surpass Windows or OS X.  Even Mac/OS X is popular among the consumers and look what this operating system is built on top of!  That being said, it does me no good to hate Apple just because I feel like it.  I bought their iPad 2 device and have been using it since it's initial launch (I did not buy it the first day of launch online, but definitely 3-4 days afterwards).  This device has been great since I purchased it the first day.  Yes, it does not support FLASH, but I realized this before I decided to buy the iPad.  The screen is sharp, the performance is fast and the screen touch is extremely responsive.  The battery life is really good compared to other devices (e.g. iPhone 4s, iPhone 3Gs).  It is a device for casual usage, you browse, you email, you do stuff for leisure.  I sometimes forget to connect the iPad to the charger over night, but I have not had to charge this device for 2-4 days, depending on how heavy I use it.  It's not like the iPhone where I MUST recharge it each night or else it will DEFINITELY run down the battery to critical level.  Granted, it's the WiFi version so it does not have the techno-complication of having to deal with 3G.  iPad 2 is very stable and robust.  I am definitely the type of person who would take every opportunity to criticize an Apple device, but I have to admit that I have had absolutely no problems using this iPad device.  I have no experience with any other tablet device in the market, but if you are wondering if you should get one or if this is going to be a reliable device, I can definitely say it has been super reliable in all phase it was made for since I received it.  Again, it does NOT support Flash, so be aware of this before you purchase it.  It's light weight, does a LOT of tasks that you can do from a computer and has a whole ton of apps available.  If you want to compare it to a computer, don't try to completely compare it apples to apples (pun intended), because it still isn't as \"flexible\" as a computer.  My laptop has a built in physical keyboard and mouse, I do not have to purchase a separate keyboard or mouse like I would have to for a iPad (you have to use the virtual keyboard on the iPad).  I can truly multitask on my Windows laptop, on the iPad it's \"semi-multitask\" at most.  The iPad cannot come close to the laptop's 8GB memory, 750 GB hard drive laptop that can run VMWare, play online multi-player games, store files where-ever I want, in whatever directory I created.  There are SO many things I can do on a laptop that the iPad currently cannot do... so unless you ONLY browse, type a few emails, make a few purchases from Amazon/eBay or other available stores and maybe chat occasionally online... then don't expect this iPad to really replace a laptop or desktop (I'm typing this review via laptop as it faster to do than on an iPad).  One negative about the iPad, but it's not Apple's fault, the Apps that people sell may be written for the iPad only or for iPhone only but sometimes written for both.  This means that if the app was designed specifically for the iPhone and you buy it... then it will not LOOK optimized for the iPad since the screen size on the iPad will make it stretched.  If you purchase the app for the iPad, then it may not even be available for the iPhone (I haven't seen an app for the iPad available for the iPhone).  Often they sell TWO different versions of the same app for both devices, so you have to pay double the amount to use them on your two devices.  Again, this review is about the iPad device, not about how the apps are developed, so overall, the iPad 2 is awesome... highly recommended for a tablet purchase.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressed with IPAD", "Author": "Miguel Gaspar", "ReviewID": "R21MQI1MA6TL7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had in the past an Iphone, and was not keen to buy one again until I was challenged to try the IPAD2.

This is WIFI only and well, my WIFI is constantly disconnecting!! It's not just my home network, but anywhere I go!! Thought maybe it was just me, but is asked hubby how his was since I bought them both at the same time last week, and his is doing the same thing!! Ugh...ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm an Android fan and when my Android crashed, I decided hey I'll buy not one, but two of these things!  Ugh...my hubby loves it, I hate it :(Pros:It is super fast!The battery life is unbelievable! Hubby played games for three hours straight and lost only 20% of the battery life!  I spent hours downloading apps and using them and had the same result. I've been using it non stop since 7am and it's now 10:30am, played my games, used Facebook and a few apps, and now reviewing...I'm at 75%. My android would have been dead long ago as well as the other cheap tablet we have.Cons: my opinion keep that in mind...It's too much of a hassle typing when you're used to a smaller screen. I'm a very fast typist, and this thing is just too big for my liking. Did I know the size? Duh! I may return it for a smaller Android though. If you need a large screen, this is perfect! My mother in law and hubby love it, but again, if you like the smaller screens, it's hard to get accustomed to.Takes FOREVER to set up! Omg, you have to create an IPad ID, an Apple ID, confirm this, confirm that, ugh...Finding apps seems to be mission impossible!  I go to the store, they aren't there!  But if I go to the browser and search, it gives me the Apple download and then I get it. So where the heck was it hiding??All in all, this is one of those 50/50 deals, either you're an IPad lover, or an Android lover. If you love Androids, don't bother.

Rhoades \"Zane\"", "ReviewID": "R3TQ8M8P4ZQASS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this particular model because I lost the one I received as a gift.  I don't want the person who gave it to me to find out about the loss.  Also, I cannot afford a new one from Apple.  I chose the vendor Sikksound because of the positive reviews.  I am conditionally pleased with my choice.  The iPad I received was in pristine condition, with an Apple box, charging cord and fast charge plug.  It also came with a textured protective backing.  I discovered that the iPad had been used in Italy because of the formatting and information I found in the settings.  After a series of very courteous and helpful e-mail conversations with Sikksound, I was able to resolve the formatting issues.However, I warn purchasers of used AT&T; iPads of an expensive and cumbersome complication.  AT&T; uses a SIM card to enable cellular data usage.  When sold by Apple, a new AT&T; iPad comes with a SIM card which allows for periodic data usage.  In other words, a cellular data plan may be purchased through the iPad for a month, and then cancelled.  When cellular data is needed again, one can simply by more data for that month, and so on.  Because of it's Italian heritage the iPad I received was equipped with a SIM card incompatible with AT&T; in the U.S.  In order for the iPad to use cellular data, a new AT&T; SIM card was required.  A local AT&T; store installed one without alerting me to the $36 fee, and without explaining that the monthly data plan must be ongoing, or the SIM card is deactivated.  A replacement SIM card from AT&T; is not renewable, like the one which comes in a new iPad from Apple.  The AT&T; store rep deactivated the SIM card within a few minutes after explaining that the data plan must be ongoing.  I only discovered the $36 charge when my bill arrived.  Luckily AT&T; removed it because I had not used any data.I rarely use cellular data because wi-if is so accessible.  However, for those who want to use occasionally use the cellular capability, you might want to do some more research.

A good one, of course.PROS:Weight: By far, the most amazing thing about this tablet is that it weighs so little. I believe it weighs less than any other iPad out there, which is weird, but I think the iPad mini is supposed to cater to those who have a problem with that. The iPad isn't meant to be held in one hand, though. It's a real personal computer, only in tablet from, and you must treat it as such. If you need to be able to read in bed or something, get a kindle or iPad mini. However, you'll find that the iPad is very convenient for most uses.Design: The front of the iPad is defined by a single pane of multitouch glass - and a home button. The back is made of aluminum. There is a front camera, a rear camera in the top right corner, and a speaker at the bottom. This simplistic design, which Apple litigiously fought for against Samsung, is in a word, magical. I'm not too much into the marketing stuff, but seriously, there is something extremely premium about Apple products, and I am sure it is more than the pseudo philosophical marketing. The Smart Cover actually works really well, though its necessity is... debatable. Overall, this tablet feels like its worth 500 dollars. Ok, so it's 400 now, but you know what I mean.Durability: The primary user of this tablet is an unhygienic now-9-year-old who is not exactly dexterous and immediately gets on it after school, sin lavar sus manos. If you know glass, you know that the only thing that can really scratch it are minerals. That's right. Not knives or cleats, though they may if you try hard enough. It's finger salts, salt from food, dust, dirt, sand, jewelry like diamonds and quartz. However, today I wiped off all the prints with a damp hand towel and I could count, I kid you not, 3 micro scratches. That's amazing. This tablet has been dropped, probably not from extreme heights, but still. The glass at the corners, along with the aluminum housing, is tattered. There are several deep scratches in the aluminum on the back. However, there are no functional damages to this tablet. That's also very nice. You probably don't need the Smart Cover for its protective aspect. You will however, want it so you can use it for support. It helps a lot.Display: Eek. I'll kick it to you straight; the resolution of this screen is terrible. If your going to be looking at pictures, you're going to be disappointed. 1024x768 doesn't cut it. My 4.5 inch S2 had a resolution of 800x640. I thought it was sub par, but acceptable. The iPad is just bleh. It's colors are amazing though. I don't know too much about outdoor performance, but I've never felt that brightness was an issue, so it's probably ok. What the iPad lacks in detail more than makes up in size. Laying down in bed with a ten inch screen feels so empowering. I feel like I have all the media in the world in my hands, and I almost do.Apps: I don't use my iPad for work. It stays at home most of the time, and at home, I have my desktop. I would assume it would be pretty easy to use iWork to create, but I wouldn't know. *flame alert* I believe Android is better for smartphones, and iOS for tablets. There is a serious lack of tablet apps for android, but I am continually surprised at the growing iOS tablet app ecosystem. However, there are a greater variety of apps on Android, in my experience. The iPad can actually handle games pretty well, despite its age. That all I really need to say. There isn't any calculator or weather or stocks app, but you'll find great alternatives in the App Store.Camera: Why are you reading this? What are you doing with your life? Why would you want to use the iPad's camera for anything except FaceTime? Seriously? Well, that's all you're going to be able to do, because the cameras on the 2 are terrible. Really. I would expect more for 500 bucks, but whatever. It's not a priority. If you ever find yourself in so dire a situation that you need to use the iPad camera, you better invest in a disposable, or something.Battery life: Ho ho. Tee hee. The battery life of the 2 makes me want to giggle. Even 2 years later, the battery life still feels virtually infinite. I can almost guarantee you, you will never have a problem with the iPads battery life. This is because if the square cube principle. The surface area (screen size) increases at rate of the dimensions, squared. The volume, cubed. More volume means more battery. So, theoretically, the bigger the device, the longer the battery life. Oh, and iOS is super efficient, almost forgot that.Performance: Welp, iOS7 is here. Anybody with anything older than 2012 must upgrade to escape the lag! Not so. Though the animations in iOS7 are super slow and can induce \"motion sickness\", the iPad 2 handles it pretty well. (I swear, auto correct has something against the word we'll.) The gaming isn't bad for such an old device, though I have yet to try out newer games like asphalt 8. However, you'll be able to stream video (not in hd, of course!) and play 2d games  with no hitches. The keyboard does sometimes take a while to pop up and apps do take somewhat longer to load, but hey, we're talking about an old geezer tablet here.Features: I haven't been able to use Bluetooth to transfer files yet, presumably because Apple wants me to upgrade and use AirDrop. Classic Apple. And I'm pretty sure Siri could easily run on the 2. Oh well, looks like we're stuck with... The two doesn't have any gimmicks, per se, to it. It has the dual cameras, but that's about it. There is nothing to show off. Just to experience. FaceTime is great, though. Like, wow. It's really the best video chat technology I've ever seen. If nothing else, I would commend apple on its FaceTime infrastructure. It's simple and fun and convenient, not to mention powerful.Overall: Even after 2 years of not so nice treatment, my 2 is functionally perfect. It really feels amazing to be able to consume content on such a big screen. The thinness and lightness of the device make it disappear as you're using it. FaceTime really is the best interpersonal video chat platform as of today. IOS 7 runs fine on this, but don't expect to be so lucky next year. I was actually shocked to see the price here on Amazon. Really? 400 bucks for a 2011 tablet? When the 5 is just around the corner and will cost only 100 more? Only a fool would buy it now. However, the 2 really bolstered the image of Apple I had. I have a first gen Nano that actually still works for a whole day! I would expect the iPad to do the same. This review isn't recommending that you buy the 2. All I'm saying is that Apple makes the best tablets out there. Even the most hardcore Android fanatic (which I am dangerously close to) could agree on some levels. iPads are feat for consuming content. Maybe even for creating. However, if you want to get real work done, you're going to want to wait for the next generation of windows 8 pro tablets with Broadwell Chips in them. I need an IDE to be able to do programming when I go to college, and the fact that no such software is available for iOS means that I can't take this there. The iPad isn't a complete replacement for a real computer. But it comes pretty darn close.Sent from my iPad", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product/Great seller", "Author": "dabrown", "ReviewID": "R3245CIL86TL5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an excellent package; iPad, cove and external keyboard.

Frankly, after the novelty wore off, it was sitting in the drawer more than on my lap.Well a month or so ago, on a whim I got the iPad 2. Within 24 hours of playing with it and discovering both powerful productivity (like aTimelogger and DayOne) and music apps (such as Synthesia, Garage Band) that fill voids in what I've seen as an owner of an Android phone, I became a devoted member of the iPad cult. From there, I tested several keyboards and have settled on the Kensington Ultimate and Logic Fabricskin.Now, after month downrange, it smile on my face hasn't worn off -- the iPad and I are inseparable.

It came with an older cover ($40.00 is what it said, but definatley not worth that today, but hey it's a cover), 2 charge cords, clean and working perfectly.  I just ran up to TJ Max to get a new cover- and it really looks like a brand new IPAd for about half the price!  I know I got a very good deal and was happy to have the seller write back immediately for all my concerns, making sure that I was pleased with the product. Don't know what happened to others, but I am very pleased with this product and the responses of the seller.  This was a great deal and I am enjoying every second of my \"new\" ipad for a great price.

I bought it to read articles (both academic PDF's and online fare via Instapaper) and play silly games, and it has exceeded my expectations on both counts.  I had used both a 7\" and 10\" Android tablet (modded Nook Color and gTablet, respectively) and a 4th generation iPod Touch in the past for pretty much the same purposes as with the iPad, and found myself not turning them on and subsequently selling them, so I was skeptical of how useful I'd find the iPad vs. a laptop or desktop.The advantage over the iPod Touch is just a matter of real estate.  The interfaces of the universal apps that I've used (ones that are available on both the iPod Touch and iPad) are much better on the iPad.  Not to knock Android, because I was admittedly using heavily modded versions of it and didn't have access to the entire Market (now Google Play, I guess), but there really are a ton of good apps available on the App Store.  There are good, efficient implementations of board games, silly puzzle games, a perfectly fine browser experience, good Dropbox, Instapaper, and Evernote apps; I could go on, but, really, there are just a ton of ways to use the iPad well.  I don't use it for much productivity (outside of Evernote and Dropbox), so I couldn't speak to that aspect.  But as a fun device that's useful to me, it's easy to recommend it to others.  If you want to spend the extra $100 for retina display, sure, go ahead and get the third generation one.

It is so easy to use and so useful. I bought the one without the cellular data ability. I didn't want to have to pay for a data plan and saved money on the cost of the iPad. That was the right choice for me. I use it all over the place with free wi fi spots so widely available. There are so many apps available that you can customize it for your needs very easily. This almost replaces my laptop computer. I hardly ever turn on the laptop anymore. The iPad runs faster than my laptop on most things online. I bought my iPad after falling in love with the one that I was issued for use in my special education class. I have been totally amazed at the things that I have seen happening in my classroom with the iPad. Any teacher, homeschoolers, or parent should have at least one iPad strictly for the kids. They are great learning tools with so many educational apps available--most free or low cost. And if you have a special needs child or student, then you doubly need an iPad for their use. It is much easier to use than a conventional computer for special needs children. And if you have a child with any disability on the Autism spectrum than you absolutely, without a doubt MUST have an iPad for your child. There are hundreds of apps designed just for people with Autism. If for no other reason than to use as an augmented communication system device, you must get this for your child with Autism.If I am asked to name one flaw with the iPad, it is that it cannot be cleaned. The screen gets lots of finger prints and gunk on it--especially with children using it. And it will get scratches on the screen, no matter how careful you are. If using it in a classroom with lots of children it can be a germ breeding ground since you cannot wipe it down with disinfectant. At school, we stick them inside gallon zip close storage bags as a good protective covering that can be thrown out and replaced cheaply.

Nevertheless, the release of the New iPad brings forth a new question: Should you buy the now cheaper iPad 2?There are many factors to be considered when making this purchase. The main upgrades of the New iPad include retina display, faster processor, better cameras, and with iOS 6, siri. My family owns both the iPad 2 and the New iPad. Apple did not change the iPad much between these two generations. It kept the same battery life, the same thickness (almost), and the same design. Thus, it is a personal decision.The devices are very similar, and most of the cons of the iPad 2 are fixed in the New iPad. However, is the upgrade worth $100-150?Cons of iPad 2 and how the New iPad uses them:Lack of Retina Display: When the iPad 2 was released, retina display had already been seen in other apple devices, like the iPod touch 4th generation. The general public was disappointed by the lack of this feature in the iPad 2. The iPad 3 had this feature. However, I don't really notice the difference. They both appear to have excellent displays. The New iPad's improved display can only be identified in rare conditions, such as viewing upgraded apps or sharp photos. Overall, the retina display in the iPad increases the memory many apps in the app store take up. For example, many iPad 2 users posted bad reviews about Monopoly HD when they had an update that increased the memory that app took up extensively. The update of Monopoly HD did not bring any new features besides Retina display. iPad 2 users were angry because now they lost memory without any benefits.Lack of better Cameras: The iPad 2's cameras are terrible. They back facing camera is .7 megapixels. On a smaller screen this would be acceptable because it is still HD, but on a 10 in. screen photos shot by the iPad camera look pixelated. The New iPad is said to have 5 megapixel cameras. Even so, the cameras on the New iPad aren't that great. Look at the video I posted so you can see the difference yourself. The video is best viewed in full screen.Faster Processor: The iPad 2 has a decent processor and is capable of doing everything you can currently do on an iPad decently. The iPad 3 is faster, especially when loading apps. The upgrade is great but not necessary.Siri: With iOS 6, the New iPad will have exclusive new abilities like Siri. Although many are not appreciative of siri after seeing it on the iPhone, the fact that the New iPad will now have it suggests that apple will continue to do this. Apple's newest products will continue to receive features that older products won't have through updates. Thus, it may be a good idea to purchase the New iPad as another one is not expected soon.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad is like no other tablet on the market!", "Author": "Granna", "ReviewID": "R1O8TKOWQEI5E1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apple's reputation for quality is unsurpassed in thier tablet.

I tried out all 3 and a few more tablets before choosing the iPad 2. I bought the iPad because-1. Navigation was smooth with the iPad. With all other tablets, I noticed that the tablet would not react to the touch every once in a while.2. The tablet is for my wife. iOS is much more intuitive than Android when it comes to tablets. the complexity of use of Android is fine for techies, though.3. Assurance of OS upgrade. I know that my iPad 2 would be compatible with future versions of iOS and that Apple would allow free upgrades. At the time of my purchase, I wasn't so sure about Android based tablets (looking at how many Android based cellphones dont get timely OS upgrades)4. Flaws in other tablets. Every other tablet has flaws, which is pretty disappointing. Xoom is good, but they dont deliver what they promise (Read up on Xoom users' agony over the micro SD unusability for over 6 months). Sony tablet doesn't come with 3G.Reasons why I took so long before buying the iPad:1. Dependence on iTunes2. No SD input3.

My girlfriend just got me one for our anniversary. Funny thing is she just got one from her mom for Christmas at my suggestion. So now we both have one.She just recently got wifi at work, too. She takes hers to work. She tends to call me about 3-4 times a day (at least it feels like that) and now she can call me on her iPad using Facetime, so she can see me as well. I don't really know how I feel about that feature sometimes, but it's pretty cool. I have other friends with iPads and iPhones and stuff, so we can all Facetime just like a house phone. It takes a little more effort to use it (just like Skype), but it's a really cool native app to the iPad. The camera quality is a bit to be desired. I think my Mac has a better camera than the iPad.Anyway, I'm not giving a review of Facetime. The iPad 2 is fast. The screen is pretty large compared to my iPod touch and my Droid X. It works well as a reader. The games work well on it. I've even used it as a drawing tablet a few times. I would link a photo I've drawn in my review, but I'm not sure I can do that.The browser works just as well as it does on my Mac and my iPod touch. It's not the best thing in the world, but it works well.Mail is still a problem for me. I can't get my Yahoo to work and I can't actually divulge why. I know the reason why and I'm not willing to fix it because it could be a slight security risk. Gmail works fine for me. I can't get my work e-mail to work either, but I haven't messed with it enough to really determine the reason just yet.The iPads are great to have around to watch Netflix and things like that. Especially when there is a toddler that wants to watch something and everyone else is watching something on the big screen.Finally, the iPads are very expensive. So far my experience with Apple in the past few years is that they build a quality product and it tends to be worth it. I hope they continue this trend. I can't say whether or not it was worth the cost as I didn't shell out the money this time.

Guess what..... Was waiting at the front door at 3; UPS showed up and so did my IPAD. Opened the box up, stiffened my resolve to not mess around until the IPAD was fully charged. So hooked the IPAD up, and waited for a full 24 hours. AFTER that, configured the machine to the wireless internet and then commenced to download EVERYTHING. The IPAD is COOL. It goes EVERYWHERE and can do practically everything. And the really weird part about this whole thing is this....my daughter, who is 4, put a claim on MY IPAD?????? Uhhh...NO. The answer is GET YOUR OWN. Too funny; For real, we share. But she did put a claim on the IPAD. All right, 5 stars, the seller gets a thumbs up as well for making sure that the delivery parcel was NON-DESCRIPT and no other verbiage was on the box either to state what was in inside either - once again the seller get a thumbs on that. Anyways, Enthusiastic about how the purchase went down, the delivery and tracking as well the product itself.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ipad2 one and only", "Author": "C.

I won my iPad 2 as a holiday party prize from my workplace. Also, I do not own an Android tablet (yet). To avoid being labeled as a Fandroid, I will list what I liked about the iPad first (yes, there are things that Apple does well):- the hardware design is indeed well thought out: thin, light, and nice to look at- construction and quality appear to be top notch- the screen display is sharp and bright- iOS for all of its shortcoming runs very smoothly on this device- tons of apps in the App store- insane battery life -> This thing has the best battery life of any backlit display device I've ever used. It probably can go 4-5 days between chargings with average web usage.- instant on -> best thing about a tablet in general: instant web browsing- the perfect device for consuming media (Web browsing, videos, games) in bedNow, on to what I didn't like:- I have to use iTunes -> First thing that the tablet signaled for me to do was plug it in to the computer and install iTunes- no back button- Safari sucks -> First thing I downloaded from the app store was Dolphin HD- no expandable storage (well known)- no Flash -> sure Adobe has decided to stop supporting this for mobile devices, but for the moment there are still plenty of sites which use it. I was surprised by how many sites to which I can't view content. For a device which purports to be great at Web browsing, this kinda sucks.- limited customization of iOS - it's a tray of icons and that's it. Barely can be called an OS.Although I hate that the iPad doesn't have expandable storage, USB ports, etc, that is the Apple way. It always has been. The Apple ecosystem is very closed and restrictive. I am positive the iPad 3 won't have any USB ports on it either. However, the main reasons why I'm only giving this device 4 stars are: iTunes, iOS and the lack of Flash. For the amount people pay for this thing, you should be able to access 100% of the sites out there. All this being said, and it pains me to say it, Apple still has no equal in producing a sexy piece of high quality hardware. Disregarding specs (i.e. processor speed, RAM) the iPad 2 is still the benchmark hardware for tablets. Just think if this thing had flash, a USB port and you didn't need iTunes to access it from your computer. Now that would be something.One additional comment on tablet devices in general. Nobody NEEDS one of these things. They are, in my opinion, the ultimate in media consumption (videos, e-books, games, browsing, social networking) which is the opposite of productivity. Seriously, the main reason I wanted one was so I didn't have to wait the 120 seconds it takes to boot up my laptop to browse the Web. And also so I could browse literally anywhere in my house. Definitely, these are wants and not needs.

Due to life taking it's own twist s & turns I was going to have to put off my purchase until next year. My boy friend bought me a poleroid e-reader 2 weeks ago to get me out of the living room after he went to sleep for the reading light as I'm addicted to everything Terry Prachet. Needless to say, while I was happy to be in our bedroom the e-reader is very limited in it's format & unless you know what your reading by heart your going to get lost thanks to missing text. Of course I am very thankful that he wanted to be generous & tried to be helpful but he knew I was unimpressed. So two days ago I was woken up to close my eyes & hold out my hands. He bought me the iPad2! The camera's are awesome, the size is twice as big yet the same weight as the e-reader. The already installed apps are great & navigating app store is so easy, let alone almost every site online that I have been to so far (20 of my favorite online news, shopping, weather etc.) already has a free app for the iPad2. There are a few interesting quirks though...1) You must have a pc to install the operating system through I tunes, but you can also go to an Apple store & they will help you.2) While it comes already installed with a YouTube app the videos aren't the best versions (due to their FLASH) but you do get the site, with most videos & songs.3) Apple IPad2 is not compatible with adobe FLASH... Not on the apps or if you just use the safari operating system to connect to the browser of your choice.4) No more zynga games, (Mafia Wars etc.) on Facebook if this will be your only mode of internet connection.5) The apps pages are in most cases very cool & graphically stimulating, however I am learning going to the same site using safari will have different content. In the case of Facebook, I couldn't view the links posted by my friends to my wall when using the Facebook app.6) The yahoo messenger app takes up the entire iPad screen & I tended to forget it was signed on to learn I was missing conversations due to web browsing... or sitting around waiting for a response.The iPad has made the last 2 days of after dinner family movies more tolerable, as the toddlers can watch their Disney movies. While I enjoy Netflix on the couch, they sung & danced to their hearts desires without me getting frustrated that I can't see Eric & Arial get thrown out of the boat for the 5 billionth time. Bed time has been fun for us all, as they are amazed I read them a color book (The little engine that could... Free in I-books) up in thier bedroom on my, \"tiny nooooooo touchy TV\".I LOVE MY IPAD2!!!! None of the aforementioned quirks are irritating enough to walk away, just things I don't know enough about or need to get used to. Considering the auto spell hasn't inspired me t9, I mean *59... ugh! Hasn't made me throw it out the window yet. But I can turn it off in the settings, which is a really cool feature with all kinds of settings & features I haven't fully jumped into yet.  You can buy the 500gb wifi external hard drive to store your movies & video's on, (as it's not expandable) plus share ability with up to 2 or 3 others, at the same time. So really it's only draw back is the whole Adobe Flash issue or I would think it is absolutely perfect!I knowI will go back to using my laptop from time to time, but right now I am so excited & inspired to find all the ways I can enjoy & use this clever machine it's going to be a while.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "IPad 2", "Author": "Cynthia Mcguffin", "ReviewID": "R257Y7YILAIZCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been VERY pleased with my purchase!

When I tried to register it Apple said it was out of warranty.  Long story short, this iPad ended up being a replacement for another unit sold by he iPad Shop back in 2011.  They received a replacement from Apple and sold it to my wife as new in September 2013.  While it might have been new it was recorded by Apple as a replacement to the original owner and thus received the warranty only at the time of return -- which by 2013 had long since expired.  Further, the serial number on the box did not match the serial number on the iPad.  After a back and forth with Apple customer service I finally ascertained that this was a replacement iPad intended for someone else and sold as new by the iPad Shop.  Apple's serial number tracking confirmed this.  It might have been a new unit but Apple changes the serial number on units they replace and would not warranty it beyond the \"original purchase date\".  Bottom line:  Go directly to Apple for their equipment.  That said, I'm not real pleased with Apple for failing to warranty an obviously new unit just because they assigned a new serial number to a customer who never received it.  I returned the iPad and bought another directly from Apple -- I'm not sure why.  Basically, I'm not pleased with either Apple or the iPad Shop.  But I am pleased with Amazon who noted that there have been similar complaints from this vendor and quickly refunded the purchase price.

When I decided that I wanted to see if iPads live up to the hype, I didn't want to go all out - I wasn't going to purchase a plan from a phone company that will overcharge me for limited data use - especially not when I can tether devices to my phone!  I also wasn't going to pay at least $100 more to get a retina display since I view it as unnecessary for me- certainly not worth the extra money (even if I do have an instinct to have the latest and greatest). I decided that the iPad2 16GB would be appropriate to base my decision!The iPad is a good looking piece of hardware - but I would say that the software left me feeling limited in what I was able to do.Pros:-It's pretty - I do love a good looking piece of technology, and in that, the iPad does not disappoint-I like the multitouch gesturesCons:-Heavy if you are reading in bed-Edges around the screen mean that I have to stretch my thumbs that much further if I am trying to hold and manipulate the device with both hands (you can always cradle it in one arm and manipulate with the other, but it just feels odd no matter how you do it)-No expandable memory - there are very few android tablets that do not offer this- get with the program apple-the App Store was not user friendly and was stubborn when connectivity wasn't fast-I find the settings app to be all over the place - settings for a single app may be in three different places (wouldn't it be nice to get into an individual app's settings from within that app)Overall, if you are looking for something simple to use and don't want to be able to do anything too indepth the iPad is a perfectly adequate choice.  iOS is very straight forward, and generally user friendly as long as you don't want to change settings for them (ie you want to use default settings)- otherwise, you may have to go on a hunt for the exact setting you are looking for (if it even exists).  I have no plan to get rid of my iPad - it works in a pinch and if I am doing something that may be hazardous to my technology, I would bring my iPad, but ultimately, I still prefer my android tablets!", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "FLASH-the IPad is a nuisance!", "Author": "James S.

The first one being the littlest Ipod from years ago.  I'm pretty impressed by it, along with my lil daughter, when she saw it being charged, she screamed \"Ipad!!!\"  lol.  The only thing that bummed me out was when it came with no battery life at all.  I had to charge it while getting the Ipad2 all set up, needless to say, it was stuck to the charger for couple of hours, while I downloaded free apps. I did notice it immediately registered Verizon, but I have AT&T; wireless internet at home and this was meant to be just Wifi only.  And not for long, it started asking if I want to add more data now or later before I can proceed with browsing.  That was an easy fix and I was able to modify it to just Wifi only. It then asked for IOS6 update while in the midst of downloading apps.  And after that, it was just smooth sailing and I made sure to enable some restrictions so my 4 yr old won't be buying any in-apps accidentally.  Read too much horror stories on that.  I did tell her to never click on the word \"buy\" because that would mean, it will take money away from Mommy!  LOL  Overall, quite happy with my big purchase.

(reiview may still need revising)", "Author": "moon fox", "ReviewID": "R3LM338BSH5SJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You are there, standing in the middle of the electronics department, credit card in hand, about to spend hundreds of dollars on a touch pad you can trust to be worth the money, and a good product. The store clerks are saying different things to you about each pad, and you don't know who to trust. Ladies and Gentlemen, the I Pad 2 is the correct item for you! It consists of app selection, optional WiFi, and other sources such as 4g. Coasting around the range of $800.00, I would suggest this particular system over any of the other available touch pads. I tried another once. I didn't like it. I would choose ipad2 over a regular i pad. why? many reasons..It is faster.it looks better based on the fact that it is so thin..Its the newest version, so why not take a go before it gets outdated?The following are my views on this remarkable contraption. Also, I'm just going to call the I pad 2 an i pad just to make it easier. Just know that the I pad and I pad 2 are 2 different products. Sometimes, i will call it an i pad 2, but just so no one gets confused while reading this, there's a fact. Hope they help!First facts: This was a bummer, but based on Apple restrictions, the i pad 2 does not have flash, so it can't play online games or run certain programs that need flash. There is also no place for discs or flash drives, so you can't download saved work such as the data on flash drives or discs. You can't download programs like Microsoft office programs on this particular item, which is not fortunate, not to mention the fact that it doesn't connect to the printer. Hopefully some day it will evolve into better stats.Camera: For the most part i like the camera, but based on the fact i haven't seen or interacted with many other i pads except my own, which has a crooked, bury camera, it wasn't the best for me, but the other touch pad i owned had a horrible camera. I don't know how the other cameras look on the i pad 2 because i don't bother to put pictures of myself out into the public on the store tester i pads, so, keep the camera idea something to check on before buying. On the camera though you can make it look straigt ahead like a regular video camera or make it face the way you are looking at the screen, so it flips around depending on what kind of picture you want. I give MY experience on the camera a B gradeApp selection: Great apps! Many apps are free, but 1 app's full version wasn't free on the i pad like it was on my other pad. I still don't think that should be a problem. Also the apps appear with fewer selections on the screen based on certain categories then my other touch pad, which appeared in a long list that was helpful. Although i would beleive that all together the ipad 2 has a wider selection of apps. Unlike some touch pads, The i pad 2 offers netflix, and many other apps that are one of the reasons i got the i pad in the first place. Great quality. I give the apps a A grade.Battery: The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes, it last a long time, but for the most part, I always have it charging. This is a issue if i want to travel with it. I'm going to have to get a i pad car charger... Anyway, the battery issue may just be with only MY i pad 2 but I'm not really sure. I would give this category a C or B grade, but it has some work to do before it reaches an A.App download speed: The apps for the most part download quickly, but there has been some times where the apps don't make any progress with loading so i usually have to delete it (and pray it will actually download) and download it again. In the end i always get ti worked out but its like, \"Come ON!\" you know? I give this category a A for it's amazing speed!WiFi quality: I love this category. Mine plays most H.D. videos and can just download apps from its app store rather then having to connect it to the computer to download things. That i can really appreciate. I can open up nearly all web-sights just the way they would appear on the internet unlike my last touch pad. I would say in order to get the full i pad 2 experience WiFi is a must-have. I give WiFi a A for great function!Speakers: Lets put it this way, the speakers... they could use some work. Sometimes when i have it to the maximum sound it is hard to hear. That is not something that i favor based on the fact that the i pad is like, 40% sound, but i still like the product. If you have this problem i suggest going to a quieter area or plugging in ear phones to assure you get the most out of your money.Covers: I don't have a smart-cover. Perhaps the smart-covers do save the battery and make the screen sleep when you put the cover over it, but i have a cover that's not a smart-cover and it is just fine. As long as you turn it off when not in use for long periods of time any covers should work. Note that the cover should fit nicely around the i pad 2, that way, it is a better buy and protects the i pad more. i would suggest a case to help protect it and make a nice little stand for it. You can't exactly rate a cover because there are many different ones, but here is my rate on how important a cover is to have to me. A B. Its optional, but a good idea.App Usage speed: Most of the apps i use are great, fast, functional, and don't have jerky movements. Take Talking Friends apps for example. They are fun, functional, and fast. Just how it should be, not to mention very clever. There isn't much to say about this particular category, but let me just say it deserves a A or B for nice function.Note where there should have been another Category view: I haven't had really any interaction with a regular i pad, so i can't say if the i pad 2 is really \"new and improved\", but i can say its good for me and very fast. Keep that in mind.Video and Photo booth: I love making videos, so i was happy to hear that the i pad 2 came with a camera ready to make some videos! It is a personal highlight. Also photo booth is fun. seeing what your pictures look like in x-ray vision, and flipped, and so much more. I really liked that. too bad you can't film videos in photo booth :( Also note that both of these are the free apps that come right when you get the i pad. the video is connected to camera app.Personal Favorites: I love the i pad 2, but my favorite features about it, are the following:.Its very thin and simple, which is very neat..The apps are great and so are their function..A i pad without WiFi is a very sad i pad..Videos and photo booth..speed!-------> ZOOMGRAND CLOSING..These are all my opinions of different category in the i pad 2. Comment if there is more you want to know about the i pad 2 and i will see if i have an answer to add to this review for you. Thanks for reading!

He loves it. We still have been unable to update it to iOS 5 because our wifi kept disconnecting on wifi on laptop but I think when we do that it will be faster. First day he had some slowness but not everything is great. We looked at getting some of the tablets on the android market and went to best buy to review. I liked the idea because the androids are more customizable but had reservations because 1. They are about the same price as iPads 2. Wasn't sure if I wanted to take that risk. 3. I have iPhones and know how dependable they are. However I found the toshiba thrive and it was cheaper. So that was our main focus. Toshiba thrive vs. iPad 2. On one hand the toshiba had USB ports, sd card ports and customization options, on the other if was not familiar with it. So we tried them both at best buy. Toshiba thrive looked better. It's graphics looked more fun, apps are cheaper..mostly free and all that. But it was more complicated, which i love because I like to tween things. My husband on the other hand...does not. So he wanted iPad...I wanted toshiba thrive but we wanted to talk to somebody who knew more about it. So we grabbed a guy who only deals with tablets. He said he has an android phone and likes it but as far as tablets go he said hands down iPad won. Reason was that apple makes one specific hardware for iPads. So they had it perfected. All their apps and music were specifically made for apple hardware so it had very little problems. Android market on the other hand is made from many different tablets, that are all made by different hardware. Therefore, if an app is made on a toshiba thrive, it may work great, but if you download it for your samsung thrive, the hardware is different so you are going to have more freezes with all, crashes or lack of working at all.In conclusion, iPad 2 so far is more dependable and perfected. I do believe however, with time, the android market will be more perfected.

I am for the most part impressed.Packaging: Apple has always impressed when it comes to their packaging. The box is very sleek and makes you very happy with your purchaseSetup: Now since this is only the wifi version, it doesn't require much setup.Now after everything was setup, I had fun connecting downloading all the apps and seeing what neat things I could do with it. I have an iPhone so I was apply to move over all my photos, songs, files, etc to the iPad and it was very easy. The plan for this iPad is to use in meetings and allow the customers to flip through the pictures or files that I am showing.Downfalls: The issues I have been having with this is that since I only have an iPhone 3GS, the tethering (personal hotspot) can only be connect through bluetooth so the internet isn't as fast as through wifi. I also wish there was some sort of case that comes with the iPad. I had to spend an additional $50 for a case to protect it. The front cases that Apple make I find are not helpful at all in terms of protection so I wish Apple would offer a better of assortment of accessories rather than having to buy 'made for the ipad' products.Overall I am quite happy and am enjoying the iPad.

The iPad 2 is so much faster and does not loose the browsers like the Acer did. The only one era back on the iPad is it seems to me that a lot of the apps that re suppose to be free are very limited and require you to purchase something to go further in the game or to play it more than twice a day. When I used the Acer they had lot more free apps than apple does and for the most part when they are free they are not limited.

One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.Software:iOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and \"productivity\" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.Overall:It's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen.

Yet, the iOS doesn't do well here. In result, reading PDFs is impossible as it causes some serious strain on my eyes. I have 20\" LCD HP crap that has ~3 less pixel density. Yet, the font edges are as good as on this IPAD. Huh.I see IPAD3 fixes this problem, but not in the iOS but with better screen - good for marketing since not many people even see any difference. In fact, people say the screen is not worth it. Huh. Makes me think if I got the eagle eyes or maybe there is a few million people who simply don't know nothing.If you don't need PDF, well, letters in Safari are terrible too.Also, I cannot believe there is no LED behind the Home button. There is even that dark square in it where LED could fit (like on HP touchpad). So, carrying it next to me, like iPhone, and checking email frequently is the way to go? That's ridiculous. If I am not using it, it's on the stand, not withing my reach. That's where LED comes handy.Also, when I click on Mail icon that shows new email, it opens inbox, instead the email. - few clicks more are needed to see the email. Terrible approach if you plan to use multiple accounts and receive many emails.Finally, Notification bar is not popping-up new messages when I am working on ipad. Why? Status bar is there all the time - showing some small icon when new message arrives would be completely unobtrusive.In summary, message/email communication interface is years behind Android.

This review is my total honest opinion on the Apple iPad 2. I have no connection to Apple and this is my honest experience with the item. Advertisements and commercials for products are always circulating twenty four-seven. This also applied to the iPad 2. I had not paid much attention to the advertisements as I was satisfied with my iPad though at the moment, and had no need for the device.One day while at home, my iPad fell out of my hands and was destroyed. I thought maybe to buy a new iPad but then the idea off an iPad 2 came to mind. The iPad 2 was released on March of 2011. I had seen so many commercials and heard so much about it. So the next day I got my little piggy bank, emptied it out and had about $28. Yeah, there was not too much money in my little piggy.I got the rest of the money from my parents, and the next day went to the closest Best Buy and bought a 16GB iPad 2 black tablet for the price of $499.99.  I also bought the 1 year accidental protection plan for $99.99, knowing my clumsy hands and bad luck. So I had spent around $600.00 on a single item. So this Apple iPad 2 I had gotten was supposed to be near perfect on the amount of money I had spent on it and way better then my iPad. Now the Apple iPad 2 was 7.3 x 9.5 x 0.3 inches in dimensions. The iPad 2 was really thin and really comfortable to hold.It was also lighter then the iPad, not by too much but still a bit lighter. Now that I told you a little bit about the physical characteristics, let me tell you the new features that make this item unique. Apple doubled the RAM in iPad 2 from around 256MB to 512 MB. This will help process graphics for games and help deliver images faster. The two cameras is also a better feature over the old iPad, one in the front facing you and one in the back. Now these cameras aren't anything special. Their digital effect is just alright and the pictures will not come out too crisp or clear. The cameras do help with video chatting and FaceTime.One of the biggest disappointments I had with my iPad was that it was never available to multi task. The iPad 2 increased RAM allows more applications to be open at once. Now these applications are available in the app store. There are close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps that work on the iPad 2. There are also Google Books, iBook, Nook, Kindle for readers on the iPad 2. I can use all these apps all day long because of the battery life.The iPad 2 battery last over 10 hours constantly on. The need to recharge battery constantly is not necessary. Now as great as the iPad 2 is with all these qualities, every coin has two sides, this applies to iPad 2. There are several things still needing improvement on the iPad 2. There is no USB support for mass storage. There is also still no dedicated SD card slot. For example, if I wanted to put pictures onto the iPad from my camera, I would need an adapter.Another distinguishing flaw in the iPad 2 is the lack of flash support. There are many programs that require the iPad 2 to run on Adobe Flash. The Android tablet on the other hand does allow Flash support. The iPad 2 is a great and impressive tablet that can be purchased in the market today. The iPad 2 is probably the best on the market at the moment. The iPad 2 isn't perfect and the price may be a bit high but if you can afford it, I would recommend it for you.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "I pad", "Author": "Willie L.

But think about WHY you want an iPad-2 or similar device, then compare the convenience and utlility of owning the devices, and Apple's iPad is very hard to beat.The big negative is the high price.  Another is no full hardware-level interface for UBS, SD, or Flash/Shockwave/Adobe support -- I can't figure out why not. You can hook several devices into the iPad-2, but in most cases (especially for cameras, SD cards, etc.) you'll need to have at least one physical media adapter.  Apple has maintained that Adobe Flash, Showckwave, et.al are obsolete, so they have no plans to support any of it.  Time will tell if Apple is correct (if not, then expect another adapter in a year or so).The positives outweigh the negatives however.The size and weight make the iPad-2 extremely easy to carry around, and convenient to use. For now, this IS a major advantage, but 'Moore's Law' about the rate of electronics miniaturization is still 'in effect', so the iPad-2's weight and dimension advantage will be gone within 2 years. By 2013, it's a good bet that all devices will be at elast as light and thin as the iPad-2, and they'll all do 'more stuff, faster' for about the same (or maybe less) money.The iPad-2's camera-system, with 'face-to-face' conferencing potential is more of a theoretical advantage than a real one: it only works well if you and the people with whom you're conferenceing have similar device capability (2 way video) and reliable broad-bandwidth availability. Otherwise, the experience and results are less than thrilling.The iPAD2 RAM memory is double that of the iPAD (512MB), which means faster performance of many graphic-intensive apps, and better responsiveness for users who like to 'multi-task' with several apps running at once.The Application software availaible fo the iPad-2 far exceeds that which is available for most competing devices, both in terms of quantity and quality. This is probably the main reason to get an iPad 2 -- you can just do more stuff (useful, recreationsl, fun, or other) with an iPAD-2, because more people have developed and marketed apps for the iPad/Apple platform than has been the case for anything else.  Given the overall state of flux for mobile computing, with platform and operating systems shifting, APPL (with a relatively stable operating platform and system) may be able to maintain its advantage in applications for some time.Worth killing people to own?  Don't mess with Apple: if you go into their stores, be sure you have enough money to get out alive.  In the mean time, April 2011 seems to be a good month in which to sell AAPL common stock.

I own Apple products (luckily I didn't have to buy them all my job did) and I've been sorely disappointed with every one. Apple products have not Flash support, no Java support, and no support for almost any video formats that are not Apple proprietary.If you want a mobile pad that plays almost any video I would suggest the Asus Eee pad both support flash, and both support Java, so that means online streaming sites work, and online flash games work.

If your warranty has expired then your only option may be to throw your Ipad away. This means that after 13 months (unless you pay for an extra year of warranty then it will be 25 months) you could be flushing $500-$800 down the toilette. Even worse, if you are still under a warranty then Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad which could have 2-3 year old parts in it. An Applette at an Apple store told me that any broken Ipads are sent back to the factory where the unbroken parts are recycled into other Ipads. In other words, if you have a 6 month old Ipad that breaks, you could get a replacement that is already 2 years old. These disposal electronics only have a 3-5 year lifespan and `refurbished' has a reputation of lasting 1 month past the end of the warranty period or 6 months, whichever is a shorter period.

This aluminum body tablet is 9.7 inches weighing 1.3 pounds making it one of the lightest tablets on the market today, also having an A5 dual chip processor and a 720p retina screen display. It comes in three sizes, 16,32 and 64 depending on your downloading and previous photos, videos and music you can choose which one will better suit you. This tablet is a must buy if you're a traveler or you want a cool gadget to play games, listen to music, take photos and view all your social networks. Not to mention its great battery life when your on the go except for when your watching movies. The layout on the device is very structured so if you're a user that has an android phone then you probably wont like the feel that the iPad gives out. If you're an apple fanatic like myself who has all apple products then this will be another great add on to the collection.  Working at BestBuy you have the exciting job to know all the truth behind products as well as being able to get them a little early, nevertheless I must say that this was worth the buy. For the average man it will cost you 500 dollars, 543.11 to be exact when you pay NYS tax but like I said it's worth the buy. Launching the iPad was a great idea, with this device you can take notes and organize your daily tasks and if you just want a device to use to play thousands of games (many which are free) then this is a great buy. Personally carrying a MacBook pro to school each and everyday puts a toll on your back, so the iPad is a easier way to have a device which can do most of the things your computer can do, it is called an accessory to a MacBook  Personally this has to be one of greatest products out there I remember when I first bought it and synced it using iCloud to my other apple devices. Apple has always had a classy start up screen, so all you see in BOLD letters is \"Welcome\" following \"IPAD 2\" in an artistic but simple manner. I take it with me to school every time so I can take my notes and search the web, not to mention going on twitter or Facebook while class isn't in session. Its your everyday \"Big cellphone\" you cant help but take pictures on it, or add music it to and buy dozens of cases as if it were on of your new cellphones. The only thing that might bother a user is that it doesn't support Adobe Flash player. Many people can't stand that because they love to watch movies and video clips and the iPad doesn't support it, that is the biggest upset with the iPad. With the iPad you have the option of accessing the Internet via Wi-Fi or threw a hotspot, which is convenient for the user making it easy to tap into the World Wide Web. Overall if this device is in your budget you should get one, preferably a black one, the white one gets pretty dirty (I have one). If you are buying the iPad make sure you also include a protection plan because if you accidently drop it (since your going to be having a world of fun) the screen will crack, it is made up of glass.

Tablets are toys. Apple tries to lock you in.", "Author": "Igor J. Gorkeulhzenht", "ReviewID": "RTBU0JS59VSB5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Tablets are toys. Last year, I dropped cable and considered either buying a Mac Mini or iPad 2 w/ Apple TV 2 and hooking it up to my TV. I decided to go with the latter. Not the best move. If you want to buy content from Apple, it may work well for you. If not, you have to jump through hoops or put up with inferior quality. Netflix and Hulu are not as good on the iPad or Apple TV as they are on a computer.In fact, I should have stayed away from the Apple line in my HTPC decision... It would have been smarter to get a nice, Sony laptop and one of the WiDi boxes that allow you to screen share your PC with your TV. (I hate the idea of plugging a computer into HDMI with a cable). Then, when you play music from your laptop to your TV (connected to a stereo), you can trip out on the visualizer. Apple TV 2 has no visualizer. It has no horsepower. It is the iPhone 4 processor packed into a hockey puck with some output jacks slapped on. (from a design perspective, it is well done. I do think Apple are still great with hardware).Tablets are toys. For example, if you want to surf the web on the iPad, there is no Flash. Indeed, people make a much bigger deal about this than it is, as most big websites offer the same content as h.264 video. However, you will run into a few that only use Flash. You can use Photon, but it is not that great. It is true that Flash on mobile devices, even Android, is not very good. See? Tablets are toys!The really bad thing is that Safari does not support the file upload html input element, so you cannot upload photos to sites like Ebay or Facebook. You need to use their apps. Why? Because iOS does not let you get into the directory structure. It is a toy. A consumer product. It is not cheap either.Like I said, I should have just got a nice Windows 7 laptop and WiDi, which would have been better than a Mac Mini and a remote keyboard. The laptop can go anywhere and can be used without the TV. Why not get a Macbook and Apple TV 2 and use AirPlay? Because it does not support screen mirroring! I think there are third party solutions, like AirPlay Server (not made by Apple). But we know why they do this. If it doesn't fit into the Apple ecosystem, they don't want to put in much effort to support it. After all, if they did that, you might watch Hulu instead of paying for shows on iTunes. I shudder to think that Apple is rumored to be interested in aquiring Netflix and Hulu. If they do, say goodbye to affordable programming...Oh, and if you want to buy a show or movie on Amazon and watch it on your TV with the Apple ecosystem, good luck. It is nit really possible with the iPad 2 or Apple TV 2, and if you do it on the Mac, you either need to plug into your TV, or maybe try the third party AirPlay screen sharing software, if it still exists or is any good...The Intel WiDi system, with devices made by a few manufacturers, had 1080p for years before the new Apple TV 2 did. If you project Hulu or Netflix, full screen, onto your TV, it is 16:9 widescreen, etc. It is simlly a better HTPC setup than I can think of! Total buyers remorse. I will have to put up with this iCrap for a few years, until it is totally obsolete...My Apple fanboy days are over. Everything I own is Apple, and I see more and more bugs and more creepy \"lock you in\" behavior every day. Look, I am not going to pay $4 to rent a movie or $1-4 to buy TV episodes. Even though I watch maybe an hour or so of video programming a day, I would end up spending $100+. I may as well have cable.With the new Apple iBooks scandal, we can all see the writing on the wall. I also see Apple products, even the Mac, becoming less computers and more consumer toys. I bought my first Mac because I am a developer and needed a POSIX environment. Many times I wish I just got a decent Windows laptop and dual booted Ubuntu and Windows 7.Apple quality has gone downhill bigtime recently. The new updates to Apple TV have it crashing quite often.To make a long story short, if you want to buy content from Apple, an iPad may be fine. But if you want Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, you should look elsewhere. What? The iPad has Netflix and Hulu and Apple TV has Netflix built in? Yes. But they are not as good as the computer versions. To watch Hulu on your TV, you have to do a convoluted process, to get it to work somewhat well:1. Close all the apps on your iPad2. Shut down your iPad3. Restart Apple TV4. Start your iPad5. Turn on screen sharing6. Start HuluThe closing apps and restarting the iPad was recommended to me by Hulu support, but restarting the Apple TV 2 seems to help a lot too. See? This is worse than Windows! Remember when Apple products didn't need to be rebooted comstantly to work?That will get you Hulu on your TV, but it is  4:3 with content cut off. The video is jerky and (appearantly due to legal reasons) they can only have a 15 second buffer size, unlike the Flash based version.I will say that the iPad 2 with Apple TV 2 can do some amazing things. A game like Metalstorm, played via AirPlay mirroring has a cool feature, where the iPad becomes a virtual cockpit (it is the game controller) and the game is on the screen. Indeed, an iPad with its gyroscope and acclerometer is a great gaming controller and gaming device.That said, if you like stuff like World of Warcraft, you are better off with a Windows laptop. iOS is a great gaming platform, but I think Windows still has an edge for deeper games.I am not a gamer. This was meant to replace cable TV, and does not do the best job. I was warned. I read a review in some tech mag that said the same thing... But I figured between Netflix, Hulu and the AirPlay feature, I had all my bases covered. Yes, but it is not a quality experience. It is often tears before bedtime.If you want a consumer gadget toy kind of thing, the iPad is fine. Probably better than any other tablet out there. But I now think tablets are a fad. The press claims they are the future. People tend to settle for less, if told it is hot stuff. Look at Twitter, or the fact that most of us listen to music that has lesser audio quality than a CD (which doesn't sound as good as vinyl!). Heck, I settled for 720p for this setup. I could have spent the same amount of money, got a quality laptop (like a Sony, forgetabout Dell and HP), and a WiDi box, and had a way better experience... Along with having a real computer that I could use independent of my TV -- something with a real web browser, real applications... I gotta say, even Safari on a Mac is pretty bad. The app looks nice, but web pages are often poorly formatted and there is a bug that prevents me from using my bank's website!See what I mean? Apple used to be the one that had quality. I think they have become arrogant and are resting on their laurels. Additionally, the influx of lame consumers combined with \"democratic design\" has them spending more time on Twitter integration than develping a decent mobile browser that can do something as basic as upload a file! Forget about Flash! These things can't even upload files! How can they? You have NO ACCESS to the file system. Even then, they could let you access the photo roll, but they were too busy setting up iCloud so they could gouge you, and putting in system wide Twitter integration for the iSheep idiots.I used to get annoyed when the Phandroids and Apple haters called these iToys and the users iSheep. But there is a lot of truth to that.I bought my iPad 2 about 10 months ago, and I have buyer's remorse. I had way too much faith in Apple. Keep in mind, they want you to buy their content. They are not going to bend over backwards to create a decent Hulu or Netflix experience. Who knows? Maybe these are purposefully hobbled so you will get fed up and just buy the show from iTunes.But iTunes is not great. I have a decent internet connection, and it takes 2 hours to download a 1 hour show. They do not stream. In my opinion, Apple is a terrible internet company. For example, you can't even watch the video, on Apple's website, about the new iPad on the iPad 2. I have tried to backup my iPad 2 for a month now, but their iCloud stuff is so dead slow, it fails after a few hours, and the progress bar says it will take 10 hours to back up -- just the basic backup!DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! The iPad is the best tablet, but tablets are HYPED! You would be so much better off just getting a nice, small, quality laptop. Given the better integration of Windows 7 and WiDi for getting your stuff on the HDTV, I would even say, forget about getting a MacBook and Apple TV 2. Forget about a Mac Mini and a cumbersome remote keyboard. I have the worst Apple hangover right now! It just hit me how limited a lot of their stuff is... Their nice ecosystem can be done better, and with more options and choices. I'd rather play music from a Windows 7 laptop to my TV/stereo through a WiDi box, and get the visualizer and all that jazz...I used to really love Apple products, but they have lost their luster. I don't think products like the iPad 2, the new iPad, and Apple TV2 meet the needs of even most consumers. The fact that the Mac is slowly becoming a big iPad makes me wish I had opted for a Windows/Ubuntu system.Did I mention that after the iOS 5.1 release and the new Apple TV 2 update, AirPlay has crashed on me about 8 times. It probably would have crashed more, but I often just listen to the radio instead now. Pathetic, eh? Yep, Windows ain't lookin' so bad now!Apple is becoming way too oriented to the average consumer. If you cut the cord (ditch cable) and go with Apple, you will pay as much, if not more for content, especially if you have a family. Don't buy an iPad 2 and an Apple TV 2 and expect Netflix and Hulu to work very well. This is no slam on either of those companies -- I think they rock! The best Netflix snd Hulu experiences are computer based (I have not tried Roku, Boxee, etc.)You should not have to pay $4-5 to rent a movie, or $2-3 to buy a TV show. WTF? I don't want to watch that same episode of The Office more than once.Just like this iBooks scandal, it is clear that Apple is here to suck you dry.

So if all your friends and family are using iPhones and iPads you will have no problem communicating with them ( well not really) .  Apple has a chip on their shoulder about not invented here.  They have proprietary apps and programs that only work and play well with same ( AirPrint, FaceTime, etc) .  Brother for instance makes one of the most popular and economical mono laser printers in he world and AirPrint does not work with it.  You have to buy an app to be able to print from iPad to Brother products. Fail.

All reviews agree on the following: 1) the ipad is still the best tablet around and 2) it is the easiest to use. Well, both statements are wrong. Since so much has been said already on the ipad let me get straight to the issues:- Being an android user (phone-wise) I got so used to the back button. On the ipad there is no such thing. If you push home, you get straight to home screen. If you want to go back one stap within an app, touch the screen and search and search for \"back\" on the screen. It is very inefficient. Also when installing multiple apps from the market you have to go back and forth several times.- The screen resolution is too low. Webpages do not look as good as on other tablets. While 4:3 format makes some sense, given that you use it also in portrait, the low resolution looks just outdated. Ok, I knew that before, but I did not expect it to be as disturbing.- Google. Apple fights its war with google to the disadvantage of consumers. No Picasa integration! Seriously, this is just poitics! They want to take control over you, so you are not supposed to use google sevices. You will also miss other google apps if you know android.- No official google talk! Say goodbye to you android using friends.- Amazon. They had to circumvent Apples policy using a web app for their services. Just because they want to force you into itunes. Once you are in itunes, you are forced into buying apple products forever. Why give up the freedom of choice? Lets say apple products were getting worse and in 5 years all your money is in itunes items. Do you want that? Hell, no. If you buy music with Amazon you remain independent of the hardware provider at least. The ipad is a mere retail channel (like the kindle fire, only more expensive). It does not give you freedom like galaxy tab.- USB. No real port. Ok, buy the adapter. 30 bucks. Find out it serves only 20mah. So it is not USB, as it is not following the standard which 100. It is disfunctional! You need workarounds.- The whole device is about workarounds. Apps. Paid apps! Apple earns on programms that give you DLNA, THE STANDARD to stream movies to your tv. Or they earn on making you buy the apple tv box. But Apple just ignores and established standard.- Antitrust, where are you? Microsoft would have been sued to death for what apple is doing here!!!- File access. Forget it. This is again about workarounds. Dropbox etc. Well, but I wanted this for my parents. Supposed to be easy, but IT IS NOT. It is f difficult to find all the f workarounds. To start actually working with this.Conclusion. Decent pad to surf with nonflash browser. Bound to apple channels for buying digital stuff, basically a retail access you are paying for. Imagine paying your supermarket just for being there. Everything else is disfunctional, not following standards, locking you in, making you search for workarounds and thereby stealing your time.

Apple made up for this by putting facetime software that is extremely sluggish on the I2! The main reason i got the I2 was to communicate with my wife and kids on facetime on her iPhone...The new design (although impossibly thin and light) is very difficult to hold. The edges are kinda pointed  and its thinness leaves me feeling like it's going to slip out of my hands. The original I pad was one of the most ergonomically friendly devices ever made.The performance (processor) isn't even noticeably different than the original. Don't try to comment and tell me \"well, the clock speed is actually blah, blah, blah...\" garbag!

I had such high hopes for this little device. Then was astonished at how it didn't even come close to my medium-low expectations.Here it goes:  The auto rotate is slow and suddenly will rotate when tilted randomly. When you don't have the wall plug-in it will not recharge while plugged into a laptop. The touch pad is either so sensitive or will NOT work At ALL after many attempts. Apple says it has a 10hr battery life - try five hours at best. A data package must be bought to use the Wi-Fi when the advertisement says it can be used right out of the package. You have to buy iTunes comparable packages to use the iPad. Free Apps are NOT all free - there is usually a fee to make them work to the point they are enjoyable. Don't even try to upload ANY of your own music or movies. Apple is sooo proprietary that if you didn't buy the music or movies through iTunes you can't use it on the iPad. And when you try to access the Internet, better-off using your Mac/PC. Moreover, accessing Wikipedia or nearly any other sites that uses videos to enhance the info, entertainment, music you can only watch around 70% of the content. Sure, the Flash is not available for iPad but it should be able to play the other videos. On Aug 5th, I called Mac customer service and the rep even said he could not believe Apple sent out the iPad 2 without some kind of plug-in or app to make the iPad more user friendly with the Internet. Oh, one more, DO NOT set the iPad face down or it will slip off nearly any surface you think is flat. The front surface is so slippery.I don't have the time to list and all negative experiences have been experienced only owning it for three months. However, I must say, the screen is bright and clear. The iPad is light and sturdy. The apps that do work, work VERY well. The processor is extremely FAST! It is not a horrible product. It just needs to mature a little.I have been using Apple/Mac and PC products for more than three decades and could not speak higher of the quality and ease of use of Apple/Mac until now. I'll probably be buying a different brand like a HP Slate 500, LG G-Slate, Viewsonic ViewPad 7, RIM BlackBerry PlayBook - to name a few next time unless I pad 4 is more compatible with reality. Please, for the love of all good things, heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS! (At least not yet.) Nearly ANY other pad/tablet at two thirds the price will do much more than the iPad 2.* NOTE * DO NOT BUY THE iPad magnetic Smart Cover.

When I did that, the screen exploded so that I have cracks running in all directions. I have purchased a new computer from Apple every year for nearly 15 years. I have 4 iPad and an iPhone plus software and I have purchased at least 20 iPods.  I have tried returning the brand new iPad to both Target and Apple. Both dogmatically refuse to help me. Apple said I would have to pay $200 to replace it.  So far, no response from Griffin.  I am sick over this. Apple is horrible in terms of their customer service now.  The used to recognize stuff like this.  I have had so many good experiences with them over the years and now they've stopped standing behind their products.  The iPad should not have done this and the case should not have been so difficult to open.  The Apple store made good and sure that I couldn't buy an extended warranty by documenting the fact that the iPad was cracked.  I am crying as I write this because the good that this company once was is now dead.

They are not for the serious gamer that needs a lot of intensive memory or extreme video. But as a good all around notebook with some pretty nifty features...It's da' Bomb! Touchscreens have been around since the early 90's, so the technology is not new, but it has come a long way since then.The fan is typical and not overly noisy. The AMD chips tend to run a little warmer than the Intel chips, but not uncomfortably so. Want a hot running computer...try an Alienware Area 51 notebook....THAT'S HOT!Folks have given Vista a hard time about not being very good...well it's the best Windows out there! Stop downloading viruses, installing third-party freeware, etc. A general rule of thumb that I use is that if I want software that works well with microsoft...then get microsoft software! I do not use Norton, McAfee or any of that other junk. I use MS One Care and it has worked for me...no viruses, no phishing, no adware.The Tablet PC feature of this notebook is pretty cool. I can use it to edit pictures, make drawings, and take notes. The pen/digitizer is pretty good and the overall cost of the notebook itself is not to hard on the wallet.The screen size is 12.1\"...take note of that all of you readers that are looking for LARGE SCREEN DISPLAYS. This is a small notebook. If you need a large screen look elsewhere. If the specs say 12.1\" screem and you purchase this notebook, don't complain about the screen being small. Take out the stander ruler, hold it diagonally, and imagine that area filled with a picture. That's how small it is. Not too hard to figure out.Touchscreens have been around since the early 90's, so the technology is not \"new\" but it has been taken to a new level.  Much like the iPhone and iPod Touch, you can do the same type of things with this Touchsmart notebook.All in all, this is a great notebook for school or small projects.

A couple of months after the warranty expired, I began to have spontaneous reboots and video problems and finally it became unusable.I contacted the HP support desk, via their online chat, and after all trouble shooting was completed, I was informed that the machine would need to be sent in for repair, to the tune of $400. I now have an $1100 dollar brick on my desk.A bit of research found that there are thousands of people in the same boat, with HP laptops that have failed in the same manner. The problem is with the Nvidia graphic processing unit (GPU). It runs so hot that the solder connections between it and the main board fail. My GPU would run over 212 degrees F and the exhaust from the cooling fans was 157 degrees F.Although Nvidia notified HP of the failing GPUs sometime in the later part of 2007 or the early part of 2008, HP continued to sell the defective laptops. Their solution was to issue a BIOS update that ran the cooling fans all of the time, which served to increase the life of the GPU, until the computer was out of warranty.You may be thinking the $400 dollar repair is a fair price to fix the laptop, so what is this guy whining about? Well, they are doing the repairs with the exact same parts that failed in the first place, so the problem is occurring again, just a few months after the repair.In short, be sure to factor the cost of the longest extended warranty into the cost of the computer, because after the 1 year warranty expires you are on your own.

Defective unit, and HP knows it!", "Author": "M. Coleman", "ReviewID": "R188MPHDL8K0UG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In the beginning, I was so excited about this computer! I bought it in late 2009 straight from HP and was overly excited about the, seemingly, infinite things I could do with this computer. I was excited about the technology--even before the the Windows 7 upgrade, it was cool. From the start, I had minor problems--the computer would shut off on it's own in a very odd way. Battery wouldn't be dead or anything, but it was frequent. The computer's fan was always on and LOUD. I always took care to ensure that it wasn't in a position to run hot, but the fan just kept on running. I called in to HP, they sent me through the Bios screen to, as I understand it, keep the fan running so that computer wouldn't overheat. Didn't help much at all. Then, not even a year after having the computer, a pink line appeared in the middle of my screen. I called to ask HP about it, they said there was nothing they could do about it--it was a problem with the screen. OK, big deal to me(because I, like everyone else here paid a whole hell of a lot of money for this machine--much more than the $525 it's currently selling for), but I let it slide. The battery needed to be replaced so quickly--I didn't even have the cheapest battery--it only lasted a little over a year. It showed signs of decline before that (a computer I used for school purposes and kept on power saving settings MOST of the time). I bought a new battery (I won't even get into the trouble I had with HP's customer service regarding that--that's a whole other issue), then a few months later, I'm experiencing my computer shutting off and making this odd sound (kind of like how cartoons sound when they run/zoom away--think road runner) while I would be in the middle of something. That went on for months before I was completely locked out of my computer. I only had the option to remove my files onto an external hard drive (which I also bought from HP--Simple Save), then restore the computer to factory settings (which took away the Window 7 upgrade).Well, I had it up and running for a little bit, just to have it go out one day after I closed it (put it to sleep) to run out somewhere for a moment. Suddenly, I remembered I had to do something else. I opened the computer to see flashing lights (I think the CAPS and maybe two other lights). I tried pressing buttons--no response. I tried turning it off (it went off), then turned it back on--same thing, just flashing lights. So finally, I decided to do an internet search by entering my computer's symptoms, only to come across a huge number of reviews/complaints of people with the EXACT SAME ISSUE. Not only that, they had done things the exact same way (computer went to sleep and they couldn't wake it back up). I read review after review--complaint after complaint. The most disappointing thing was that everyone had the same issue--HP didn't care. They would not fix it or even acknowledge it as an issue with these computers. Most people were like me and out of warranty.Well, HP wasn't going to help, so I went to good old, trusty Youtube to find a solution. Amazingly, there were several videos of people either replacing motherboards in the computer, or taking the computer a part and adding silver compound and a penny to rectify the problems, sometimes. Unfortunately, after CAREFULLY/METICULOUSLY taking my computer apart and trying the fix, my computer was not fixed. Although I was able to move the majority of my files on to my external hard drive, previously--I had since bought some songs on itunes in between updating my back up and when it died on me. I guess the only way I'll see those files again is if I purchase an enclosure for my internal hard drive or something else to get my files off. How disappointing is that?! The computer that keeps on costing! As someone who believed in HP products and had an HP desktop in high school and a lap top in college that lasted me quite a while, I am very disappointed in my experience with this computer and with HP's customer service when it came to resolving this issue. I'm also disappointed that HP sees this computer is defective, yet they've made ZERO strides to resolve this issue. Needless to say--after years of me and my family purchasing HP and Compaq products, we'll never lay a hand on another. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER! It'll be the worst mistake you've ever made!

The main issue seems to be almost entirely due to the slow processor speed and cobbled together software package.The computer runs significantly better on Windows 7, but is more prone to glitches and ominous blue screens. (Though perhaps a fresher installation of Windows 7 would fix this). Once support comes out for Windows 7 from Asus (drivers) and W7 is released, I think this can once again be a handy little machine.

The T91 is great for online course content, as you can push buttons and click through equations and slides with just a tap on the screen.  I've quickly become so used to this awesomeness that I keep mistakenly touching the screen of my older, bigger laptop, expecting a mouse click.For fun and utility the T91 really can't be beat. I have all my textbooks on board, so it's the only resident of my bookbag save for my note paper. The screen-swiveled tablet mode is great for reading and reviewing slide shows and notes. And walking around campus it doubles as an mp3 player and a (web) radio!The only minor annoyances are a less-than-perfectly-responsive keyboard (please, Asus, tune this up in the next version) and the 1GB of RAM - I highly suggest upgrading to 2GB, unless you're a more patient soul than I.This is fantastic product for the price, and it allows for some seriously new and exciting uses.

Murray \"PhantomWolf\"", "ReviewID": "R284W3C3WNNFRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok I've read the reviews here and I am not amused... As a computer technician I know and trust Asus products without question,and with my recent purchase of the T91 my trust has only grown.First off for the yokels that bought this for heavy work loads... you're a moron case in point; with a 16 Gb SSD (solid state drive) and 1 Gb memory topped off 1.6 Ghz processor and a 8.9\" screen did you really think that this could handle that kind of work load? And for the idiots that scratched the surface of your touchscreen with the stylus do you poke your wife or girlfreinds like that? If you do bet you spend alot of time \"Alone\".As a tech and a Sales executive for my own firm I needed a laptop that 1. I could travel with that wasn't to cumbersome (specially when I'm flying) and 2. when I was up in someones roof or in their wall fixing their network I could still have information and a great test tool at my finger tips. The T91 did that and never broke a sweat...if you haven't figered it out then let me spell it out for you...\"I LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!\" My T91 has taken over as mission critical equipment in my work as a tech, I use her to trace network cables, shorts and hub problems. she connects to my test equipment and gives more information on the problems I face. Wireless interfarence and blind spots are no longer problems that bother me.So you want a good system to do a few things when you're on the road? want something not to bulky, enough speed to get info on the road, or you're a tech looking for a cheap alternative to buying high grade test equipment on a buget then look no further... The T91 in my opinion is a great buy and a great netbook / tablet.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "My darling little computer", "Author": "Gina \"The Gina\"", "ReviewID": "R34303BDHA9L78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really happy with my Asus Eee PC T91. The keyboard is perfect for my wrists (I have thin hands and long fingers). I love it so much I have bought a replacement battery and went through the long involved process of installing it (it is not user accessible) with the help of a youtube video.It is now a lot heavier than it used to be. Probably because everything else has gotten lighter and so now it seems more cumbersome.It does have a problem with the screen. The left fifth of the screen looks like it has an overlay of a transparent magenta. It has been that way since a short while after I got it. It just wasn't worth it to me to deal with doing something about it. About two years ago it lost the ability to notice when the lid was closed so it didn't go to sleep on its own.

It runs much better in Windows 7 just for the fact that Windows 7 supports Tablets right out of the box.Hard drive is a bit too small - 16GB is never enough, and I have to uninstall programs before I can even get a clean Windows 7 installed into it. After Windows 7 I have about 5-6GB left, and I seriously doubt I will install anything more to it at this point except some small utility softwares.Touch screen works great but expect minor delays in actions, although this may be common to all tablets.Performance is a bit sluggish but understandable.  This netbook is used primarily for my emails, browsing, and web TV, and reading - I don't use it for anything else and should not be.Overall not bad but not as intuitive as IPad (that is the OS problem not the machine itself).  The good part is it offers much more external ports that IPad can offers, so you will be able to connect multiple things to it.It is small, lightweight, good looking, and does well for what it intends to ... otherwise it is hard to type, a pain to look at the tiny screen for an extended time, a bit slow, and can't get everything you need into it.I guess that is the two sides of the same coin.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Netbook", "Author": "Slugo", "ReviewID": "R1RCW6QVEGUN7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the product from a referral and am happy that I did.

Merchandise delivered on 10/27/2010 as promised. Absolutely no regrets with my order. The price was the driving force behind my purchase. SD card and card slot became defective and I had to returned it. Amazon exceeded my expectations with their handling of my replacement unit and return authorization. Enough to make them my primary online retailer for all further purchases.I upgraded the memory to 2GB. Although the 1GB chip seem adequate, I preferred the added memory for better performance. This unit shipped with Windows XP and I am impressed with the overall touch performance in general, especially considering that it is a resistive touch screen. Being a Computer Science Major who is almost finish with my degree requirements, I installed Windows 7 (free) under the Academic Alliance Program with the community college that I am enrolled in. I am running a dual boot (Windows XP and Windows 7) from the 16GB SSD. Windows XP handles well and is the primary focus. The computer is small, lightweight, and is ideal for portability. Functionality is great and is a good alternative to the IPAD. Since showing off some of it's features and functionalities, I have had several colleagues order the same computer from Amazon. I gave it only four stars solely because of the small hard drive (despite the 16GB SSD card and 20GB of free online storage).

Having bought it im a little disappointed. First off its just too slow for the touch interface to function properly. The shift and enter keys are very poorly placed. The touch pad doesn't work very well, it occasionally thinks you are trying to do something else than move the cursor. If you use the touch pad to write there is no \"interpolations\" i.e. your writing looks like you wrote it in paint. All in all they should have held off on this till they had improved it a little but on the upside you do get a lot of features for a low price. I especially appreciate the ss-hdd and Bluetooth.

I wanted a Windows-based system, as I've had less than satisfactory results trying to edit Word docs with other OSs like Chrome. I've also found Windows 8 frustrating to use for several reasons. Being somewhat of an old fogey, the last version of Windows I really felt comfortable with was XP, so I prefer using that. I've had this little gem for over a month now and love it! The only negative thing I can say about it is that the keyboard is smaller than a standard keyboard so that my typing speed suffers a bit because of that. But I'm learning to compensate for that, and it's definitely not a deal breaker. If you're someone who has to have the latest and greatest, then this isn't for you.

{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Usable With Home Owner Flaws", "Author": "George Allen Papapetrou \"Allen\"", "ReviewID": "R39O5H7I27H78P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Edit 20110314: I no longer recommend this to anyone. This product is Version 1 running Android 1.5. The new 7HT is Version 2 running Android 2.1.[...]The 7HT is the fourth Archos product I've owned. Aside from the Gen 1 Jukebox, 5IMT amd 5IT, I purchased three 7HTs.  Two as gifts for friends. Both my friends are technical types, not your average Home Owner to whom Archos markets the 7HT.Personally, I am very pleased with the 7HT.  It does everything I wanted it to do.  However, I'm a retired techie and I found workarounds for flaws which would hamper the average Home Owner.  I'm also a moderator on the ArchoFans Support Forum and focus on the 7HT forum.Flaw 1:As delivered the Archos 7HT cannot create new folders.  This flaw prevents using the 7HT as a Digital Photo Frame with the supplied App - Photo Frame.  Photo Frame treats folders as \"albums\" for displaying slideshows.--Workaround: Install an App like ES File Explorer which can create new folders.--Conclusion: Works fine for me now.Flaw 2:Archos provides the Aldiko eReader.  I downloaded two books before I installed an 8G microSDHC card.  After I installed the 8G card Aldiko \"lost\" the books I downloaded previously.--Workaround: Don't use Aldiko before you install a microSDHC card.--Conclusion: Works fine now and I have over 100 epub formatted eBooks in Aldiko now.Flaw 3:The Archos 7HT has an Unexpected Wake from Suspend every two hours.  I had a drop from 81% battery charge to 18% after 4 hours and 36 minutes when I had the Screen Timeout set to Never.--Workaround: Installed FastBright app to switch to a minimum 5% screen brightness and set the Screen Timeout to 1 minute.  With these settings I've experienced only a 3% to 5% battery decrease.--Conclusion: Works ok now. Only a firmware update will eliminate the Unexpected Wake from Suspend.Iffy:Out of the box Video playback did not work for all the videos I tried which did play on my PC under VLC and on my Archos 5IT. Some folks at the ArchoFans forum have no problems and others have plenty of video problems.--Workaround: Convert videos via a PC program. I've found one group of settings which work and am still searching for more.--Conclusion: Works ok for me since I'm more interested in eReading and less in video playback.Note 1:The 7HT does not support video out despite what you may read at Amazon or elsewhere.Note 2:A USB adapter, micro A male to A Female, is required to use the 7HT as a USB Host for thumb drives, USB keyboards, mice, and powered USB hubs.  These adapters are difficult to find as not even Amazon has any.  The USB receptacle on the 7HT is micro AB and the supplied USB cable is micro B for USB client mode.Note 3:Out of the box the 7HT has no support for WiFi file copies.  An App like ES File Explorer provides this.Note 4:I doubt if Archos will provide additional firmware updates to correct the \"flaws\" I mentioned above. They outsourced the Android development and are working on the new Gen 8 software.Note 5: (Update 20100923)In mid-September Archos did update the firmware. While I've seen no corrections for the \"flaws\" AF forum members and I have found the touchscreen to be more responsive and satisfying.Conclusion:If you're an average Home Owner and want the 7HT to \"work\" out of the box, I'm afraid you will be disappointed.  If you have a gadget or Android or techie background the 7HT should work for you and at $200 is a great value.  I recommend you join a forum like ArchoFans to get the most from your 7HT. For example, recently one of our ArchosFans members got the Google Android Market working on the 7HT.Allen", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "For my usage, better than the iPad", "Author": "Kamal Patel", "ReviewID": "R3FLOMZQ2SRH9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As others have said, it's a good value for $200.  But I take that a little bit further and say that I'd rather have this gadget than the $500 iPad.  Why?  Here's why.-It is smaller and almost half the weight.  This makes it comfortable to hold and view with one hand, which is difficult with the iPad.  I plan to hold on to it and watch videos while stationary biking at the gym, which would be difficult with a bigger tablet.-The screen is matte.  It has much less glare than the iPad.-I use it mainly to watch videos.  In this capacity, it excels, supporting more video formats than the iPad, and coming in a widescreen format instead of 4x3.-It does most things as well or nearly as well as the iPad.  Aldiko is a great ebook reader, you can download Swype to make typing super fast, videos and music play great, etc.-It plays youtube and flash videos if you use the Skyfire browser.Of course, there are drawbacks.  I wouldn't give it a low rating though because it's missing features that only come with $500 tablets.-The screen is resistive, and occasionally doesn't register your tap.  This improves with time, if you turn on the click-on-tap sound setting.-The Android marketplace doesn't work from the device.  To get apps beyond the basic ones, you must either install another marketplace (like Slideme) or search around the web.-The chip is supposedly slower to lower the pricepoint.  I haven't noticed this much.So for a student, or younger working type without much cash, this is an insane buy.  Tons of tablets will be coming out this year, but this one works perfectly fine and may still be cheaper than anything else coming out for a long time.  7 inches is a perfect size right in between small phones and big iPads, and I've enjoyed using it in various situations during the week I've owned one.Enjoy!", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "An amazing value", "Author": "Diknak", "ReviewID": "R1UGJQ6UC456AK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got mine last night and I am very happy with it.  I gave it five stars, not because it does everything under the sun, but because it is a great value for $200.  Some things I write below compare it to expectations from smartphones and tablet standards, but they should be taken with a grain of salt because of the low price tag.Likes: I love the form factor.  Archos has provided a proof of concept and I can't wait for the 7\" Android tablets to flood the market later this year and next year.  It is very light weight and awesome for laying in bed or on the couch while surfing, reading etc.  The form factor is just so much more enjoyable than a 10\" iPad.  The video quality is just stunning and will make an excellent travel companion just for this feature alone.  Typing on the device (with Swype) makes this a great tablet for writing short emails and getting on facebook.  The attached kickstand is very convenient and I'm sure it will get tons of use.  I just hope that it won't break since it is plastic.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the system very snappy and responsive since I was expecting a little bit of lag time due to the specs.  I would have liked to see more processing speed and more memory, but who wouldn't?Dislikes: Of course the resistive touch screen is the top of the list.  I would have liked to see capacitive, but market limitations just didn't make that possible.  I'm sure there will be a lot of 7\" tablets with capacitive screens released later this year.  I would have liked an accelerometer, but I haven't missed it yet.  I'm sure that I will run across an app that will make me miss it, but nothing so far.  I don't have to worry about the orientation changing unexpectedly when laying down, so that is a plus.  The 1.5 version of Android was a terrible mistake by Archos and, in my opinion, inexcusable.  1.6 should be a bare minimum at this point and I am going to run into a lot of apps that won't work.  I would have also liked the ability to charge the device over USB (you have to use an outlet).Other Thoughts:  If you are in the market for a great 7\" entry level tablet, this is a great buy and you won't be disappointed.  If you must have top of the line and can't see yourself happy downgrading services from your Android phone, then you might want to hold off until later this year.  I am part of the [...] community and that is making this device much more enjoyable because we have a wiki of confirmed supported apps along with other information.  Some people have reported defective devices, but it seems like a small portion of the population, so that is nothing out of the ordinary.  Archos has already released one firmware update, and I hope more come in the future.  With the limited memory and processing speed, a task manager is an absolute MUST have.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "The 7-inch LCD simply ROCKS!", "Author": "Jung Il Lee \"ProGolferDigest.com\"", "ReviewID": "R2W8Q83EGSEU13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first, I got this device and felt like returning it.  But after using it for like 2 days, I have found that you can view YouTube, other video sites (even porn, just goto the mobile versions) by installing the SkyFire browser.Also, I own a Nexus One, which runs Android 2.2.  The Archos 7 streams videos flawlessly than my Nexus One, I believe that's due to its added GPU processor.Other than that, this device is great because you can simply load avi, mov, even DivX files and you can play it back in crisp 720P HD.The resistive touchscreen was sorta cheapish at first but for the price you pay, I rather have the cheaper resistive than capacitative since you can browse websites without any pinch-and-zoom due to its large 7-inch LCD.Anyways, I hated it first when I just got the device but after using it couple days, I am lovin' it as it's replacing my internet browsing on my smartphone.Also, internet radio is great too since I can literally put the device anywhere in my kitchen, all while browsing the web too.  Multi-tasking is pretty good, although not super fast.Seriously though, this is the best Android Tablet you can get right now for the money.  I know there's a bunch of larger 10-inch android tablets coming out later this year but the price isn't going to match up with Archos 7.Even my kids love it since I can put some Spongebob videos and they can watch it without asking me to boot up my secondary laptop, then play it.One thing I really love about the device is its fast boot-up time and sleep mode.

Having not owned an e-ink e-reader, I cannot make direct comparisons.  But on its own merit, the archos 7ht is a very functional e-reader.  I easily loaded my wife's ePub books and I can control things like font, font size, portrait or landscape view, multiple bookmarking, and the best thing for me is reversing the colors so that the text is white on a black page.  This makes reading in the dark very easy on the eyes, and probably extends battery life as well.  It also allows changing the brightness, which is helpful in various lighting conditions.In addition, I get a versatile movie and music player and a decent web browser!Pros:great form facturegreat battery lifegood screengood e-readerdecent web-browserversatile movie and music playerdroid marketplace is a bonus, as this isn't something my wife would even look atCons:touch screen inaccurate/insensitiveglitchy firmwareold techalthough it advertises playing movies at 720p, it cannot play a high bitrate movie smoothly.This is not a hassle-free product, but I wasn't expecting it to do everything really well.

Since having it for almost one week, I have tested just about every feature it comes with.  Like most reviewers, the touch screen is a little picky, but I like that feature as compared to my HTC phone which is hypersensitive and I make many mistakes.  The WiFi feature is really above my expectations and connects to my internet immediately.  I have done a lot of surfing with it and it never fails to impress me.  What I really like is the quality of the videos...simply outstanding. The music system is also very good and I like not having to deal with iTunes (all systems should be drag and drop).  What was most impressive was the bookreader.  It comes with a couple of books for you to load and the quality is really good.  I have loaded a couple of apps games for my grandson and the unit really delivers.  I don't want to forget the photo feature and the slide shows you can do with it. What Archos has delivered is really outstanding, especially considering the price.  If I want an iPad that connects to the internet, try $650 or more and the cost of a data package.  Archos really hit a home run with this one, especially going with the android OS.I recently had a company, named Boxwave, manufacture a screen protector for my Archos 7 Home Tablet.  I had tried several screen protectors, but the best one out there is made by Boxwave.  Unfortunately, they told me they did not have one for the Archos. However, they said if I would take the measurements and send to them, they would manufacture one for me. I have used their screen protectors on my phone and they are outstanding.  Also, I did not like the reflection of the Archos screen or the other screen protectors.  Boxwave manufactured one out of anti-reflective material.  I just received it last week and put it on.  What a difference it makes and the touch screen appears to be more sensitive than without it.  That makes a big difference to me.  I highly recommend Boxwave for the screen protector.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Archos 7 Home Tablet is a Good Value for the Price", "Author": "Gadget Guy 88", "ReviewID": "RESYEZOZ0ULJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Archos 7 Home Tablet is a decent surfing device if you're looking for something with a larger screen but don't want to spend a lot of money.  I have an iPod Touch and was looking for something larger for surfing.  This device is by no means an iPad and I knew that going in.  You are able to multi task such as streaming Pandora or iHeartRadio while surfing the web.  I use the Touch for some games (which I haven't played on this) and apps, but found myself more often than not wanting a gadget for surfing the internet that had a larger screen.  This device is also an excellent e-book reader and has an app where you can download a TON of free books!You can play Youtube videos if you install Skyfire.  The video quality is excellent and speakers sound good.  The app library is not the full Android Marketplace and it would be nice if it were able to access it.  You can find apps around if you're patient and don't mind messing around a bit.  I upgraded the firmware to a newer version first thing (it will erase any apps you had that didn't come with it so do it if necessary right away before downloading too many apps.)I wanted to experience Android and for once get in as an early adopter of a tablet rather than waiting.  The resistive touch screen interface can be tricky but you get used to it and can swipe, just not flick like the i devices can do.  If you buy it (and for the price if that's what you're willing to spend I say do it) just give yourself a few days with it before deciding if it's for you or not.  Engadget said you get what you pay for and I tend to agree with that statement.  I was willing to spend what this gadget cost and I'm good with it feeling comfortable that I have a nice surfing and media device with a larger screen.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value for the Money", "Author": "R.L.", "ReviewID": "RFY9HWD2YMLG4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Considering that the Archos 7 costs less than half of what an iPad costs, this tablet is a great value.  It surfs the web, grabs your email, has apps and can do Flash.  The built-in Wi-Fi is easy to configure and can pick up signal easily.  The screen is bright...very bright...enough for outdoor use with ease.The only drawback would be its touchscreen.  It is older technology and not as sensitive as the iPad, but again - less than half the cost of an iPad.Watch out Apple!UPDATE 06.25.2010I finally had a chance to install the Skyfire browser.  It immediately doubled this tablet's value.  I now can view Flash videos, including Youtube and news site videos - i.e. CNN.The Skyfire browser was a little hard to find especially since the Archos does not have access to Android Market.  I had to search and download the .apk file from my desktop computer, copy it to a mini-SD card, and run the install on the Archos.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everything you could want for $199", "Author": "Mcdonald Mirabile \"macmirabile\"", "ReviewID": "R2HHXZNAGDGMR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I have used Archos products for the last 8 years, I used some of their first hard drive based MP3 players and later the PMA-400, which in 2006 had wifi, audio, video, etc.  I've never been very impressed with their operating systems on their media players, so I was excited when I saw they decided to go with Android 1.5.Android 1.5 seems to work very well on this system, at least relative to their prior OS.  It's not as fast or as smooth or perhaps as stable as an iPad's OS, but in my opinion it's a small sacrifice to save $300+ (to upgrade to an iPad).  One of the best features of this device is its use as a book reader.  Literally within 15 minutes, I had downloaded an .EPUB file from Barnes and Noble's website to my desktop and then copied to the Archos mounted on my PC.  The preinstalled book application, Alkido, was able to easily import the file and within minutes I was reading.  HOWEVER, the only .EPUB files you can view through any Android based ebook readers are ones without DRM (digital rights management).  The samples from B&N; do not include DRM.  The actual books when purchased, however, do.  This means you CANNOT USE THIS TABLET CURRENTLY TO READ ANY .EPUB BOOKS DOWNLOADED FROM SITES LIKE BARNES AND NOBLES.  There are thousands on non-DRM books available for free which are easily accessed within the Alkido application, however, and this is enough for me.The screen size on the Archos is just about perfect.  The iPad is too big, the iPod/iPhone too small, this is just right for videos, web surfing, and certain book reading.  Speaking of web surfing, the interface is a little awkward at first, but you get used to it.  It's also maybe a tad slow surfing the web, though the appslib and slideme android application browers run fine.The video and audio playback seem to work well too, though I haven't tested any 720p media. The one final thing I want to mention here is the touch screen -- it's not close to the quality of the iPad, which I have used fairly extensively.  It's crucial to carefully calibrate it at startup or you may have typing issues.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Too Basic...my Droid 2 does better", "Author": "Desy", "ReviewID": "R1QNA438AY92E5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this device, so that I could watch music videos on youtube, or anime (mkv files) while I work out. I wanted to love this thing, but I just couldn't make it work!Pros: Nice big screen, clear and crisp, speakers decent, fairly light weightCons:Shoddy design - I've seen a couple reviews that mentioned this, but it happened to me too. The back panel is made of thin, reflective metal. With 1x use, the heat from the unit actually WARPED the panel. There was a palpable space underneath the panel, so every time I handled the device, it made an audible snapping noise as the panel flexed. Super annoying, and I imagine eventually the whole panel would have simply fallen offCupcake - I've read this term on a few reviews as well, from the more advanced users. I didn't quite understand at first, but basically, it comes with an older version of the android OS. You have to be willing to MOD the hell out of this device to get it to do anything advanced (and the tech/geek forums were great resources). However, even after hacking/installing the free marketplace, I found that half the apps didn't even run reliably.Freezes - multitasking sucks, very slow between screens and frequent freezing. Once I spent 40 mins staring at this useless device while on the cross-trainer; I was unable to unplug my headset from the device because it was frozen on the Pandora app, but still blasting out 1-2 second segments of a song every 3-5 minutes - I didn't want to disturb the other people in the gym. The device wouldn't turn off.The reset button has a very tiny access - most large paperclips wouldn't fit into it, I needed to eventually use a safety pin.Movie player sucks - when I read that it could handle MKV and other popular video formats used by my favorite fansubs, I was stoked! The device failed at everything else, I thought at the very least if it could play my anime, I'd forget all the pitfalls. No go - supports mkv, but no subtitle functionality. Fail.Hot Hot Hot - this thing gets hot...Browser capability - couldn't get the youtube app from hacked Market Place, so i was stuck using Skyfire browser to attempt to watch videos online. More often then not, it did not recognize that there was a video on the page I was viewing. It's an ongoing issue, as youtube continually change the flash features on their site; skyfire just doesn't keep up with the updates timely enough...but hey it's a free android market app - that's expected. Access to the youtube app would have fixed this.Touch screen - not a big deal to me, but it was quite difficult to use at times with the slow and sluggish responsiveness. I have to re-calibrate almost with every use.So...I ended up returning it.

I had only used capacitive screens until now, and I figured that resistive screens probably got too much of a bad rap... but it's deserved.

I'm primarily displaying books that have *lots* of graphics, and scrolling and/or page turns have to be fast.  I normally use my netbook for this, but it doesn't open flat, and thus can't sit on a music stand.The first one I received kept shutting off randomly, sometimes before it even finished booting.  Installing the latest firmware and keeping it plugged in didn't help, so I exchanged it through Amazon.  The replacement works much better.The battery life is good.  I generally leave it suspended most of the day, with some reading, audio, and occasional wifi use, probably a total of 3-4 hours/day.  I haven't gotten the battery down to 50% yet - the only time I've even come close is when I was using wifi extensively.The touch screen could be better, but for the price it's quite reasonable.  I haven't had any significant problems using it - I have more trouble with the one on my phone.  There are occasional glitches where it will pop up the notification screen or the volume control, but I'm pretty sure that's the software, not the screen itself.  I've never had it do that while turning pages in a book, for example.The screen isn't too glossy, and doesn't seem to need a screen protector as long as you aren't doing anything likely to scratch it, like using a stylus.  The case I bought came with a free screen protector, which made the touch screen much harder to use.The clock ends up way off if you leave it suspended.  I found a reference to an older firmware update for the Archos 7 Internet Tablet that fixed this problem, but the latest firmware for the Home Tablet doesn't fix it.  Tech support didn't know when this might be addressed.  There doesn't seem to be any way to remove the clock from the status bar, so I have to try to remember not to take it too seriously :-)  And, of course, using the alarm clock is out of the question.The built in photo frame and photo viewer sort by file write date.  If you know what a shell script is, you should have no trouble working around this.  If not, this is part of the \"not for beginners\" stuff :-)  I have found that the photo viewer can be useful for reading short books that are mostly graphics where high quality is important, e.g. music - represent each page as a picture.  There is a limit on how many pictures it will read, but I haven't bothered to pin it down exactly.  There is a slight delay while it draws the next picture - I haven't decided yet if I could get used to using it this way for anything other than practice.If you have the brightness turned all the way down in the built in ebook reader, the backlight may not get turned on when resuming from suspend.  If you have configured it to allow you to adjust the brightness while reading, you can use that action to turn on the backlight.If you are using a file manager that allows you to open files, you can import .epub files into the built in ebook reader by clicking on them.  They are deleted from their current location once the import is finished.The pdf readers I've tried have been painfully slow - I'd be ready for the next page before the current one is finished drawing.  It doesn't look like pdf is a viable format for anything serious on this platform.Page turns in the built in ebook reader are pretty quick, but opening a chapter can take some time, particularly if it is large.  Navigating via the table of contents is awkward - you can't just open it in a side pane like you can on a normal computer, even though the screen is wide enough to support it in the default landscape mode.The built in html viewer works ok for continuous scrolling, although I wish I could put it into portrait mode.  Scrolling can also be a bit tedious with the resistive touch screen.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sub-standard screen scrolling", "Author": "L. Hayward", "ReviewID": "R8U8QLS7IV9S9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the Archos 7HT with 8gb Flash memory in Jan 2011 and promptly returned it. Why?Pros: There's much to love about the Archos 7HT. Size, weight, features all wrapped into a fast interface. The high-def video is superb. The sound when listening to music is excellent, but only if you use headphones. The Aldiko eReader is top of the line and provides access to one of the best epublishers on the market: Feedbooks.  Last, but certainly not least, is the price point of under $200 making the Archos 7HT (seem like) a real steal; however...Cons: Although the Archos 7HT runs Android, you don't have access to the Android Market and the average user won't know how to get it. Instead, Archos gives you access to the Applibs Market which leaves much to be desired as the choices are very limited in comparison.  The real deal breaker for me, and the sole reason for returning it, is the HORRIFIC and unforgiving sensitivity when screen scrolling. It just doesn't work. Period.  While trying to move a page around or scroll through a list, it will open a menu or press a link that you didn't want. I nearly tore my hair out over this defect. I knew the scrolling was sub-standard before I purchased it, because of all the complaints about I read in the reviews, but I thought \"How bad can it really be?\" It's bad. Real bad. Believe me. There is no work around to this defect. Using a stylus doesn't help, nor does downloading an app, which was suggested to me. I loved the Archos so much that I tried everything to get the scrolling to work, but my efforts were for naught. It's almost like driving a car with a steering mechanism that doesn't work properly. It has a mind of its own and you never know where you're going to end up. Take my advice: Stay away from this product.Kudos to Amazon for their excellent return policy!

I knew I would have to manually install apps that aren't in the Archos AppsLib application, since Google doesn't support this through the Android Market. Also, it's currently running Android 1.5, nowhere near the upcoming release of 2.2 for Android phones. They'll hopefully upgrade it to at least 1.6 soon, anything past that may be beyond the capability of a firmware upgrade.Other than that the only really sucky thing is that it can only recharge using the 'wall wart' power adapter, it doesn't recharge via the USB cable. So I'll pick up an aftermarket adapter and a compatible car charger so I can keep it juiced up at work and on the road.The resistive touchscreen doesn't respond like a capacitive touchscreen, you actually have to tap or push and drag to make things happen. Engadget whined about this quite a bit, but it's no big deal and you get used to it quickly. As a previous owner of old-school Fujitsu tablets, no big deal to me.Video quality is very good, displaying 720p and keeping up with a variety of video codecs. Audio quality is actually quite good as well, but don't expect anything resembling bass response. The two built-in speakers do an adequate job for their size, and connection to external speakers greatly improves things. There are multiple preprogrammed EQ settings, and the capability to customize your own.Enough for now, gotta go play some more. I'll update the post in the next few days with additional observations.

Younger", "ReviewID": "R2EALVAJOT606M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this tablet a few days ago. I knew what I was getting into because I had read the early reviews of this product. I got this mostly for using it on the go when I want to use the internet. I wasn't disappointed until I tried Youtube and Facebook via the included web browser. I had to do research online to understand the tablet better before. I also told myself \"It's only $199 so if I don't like it..I'll send it right back\".Two days ago, I installed the Skyfire browser which DOES use Flash and allows youtube viewing. (Take that, Apple!) This made a huge difference for me and it's one of the best web browsers I've ever seen. I have not tried everything yet but as a media tablet...Its GREAT! I just wish it used a different memory card but I can live with it. With my psp, I used my neuros memory card reader connected with my tivo to transfer my TV shows. I'm still experimenting with the tablet to see how I can best transfer my TV shows to it without a computer. As for a computer and TIVO, using TIVO Plus software or connecting it to the PC works extremely well. It would be nice if the tablet had a captioning feature but I'm not complaining.I can use Facebook just the same as on a computer with all the flash games via Skyfire browser which is great.  You can't do this on an Ipad. One Ipad owner I know is actually taking back his Ipad to get this tablet this feature alone.As for the screen, you get what you pay for. You can watch HD quality movies and there's great screen brightness control too. One reviewer said he gave up on the screen calibration and wanted to send it back. That's coming from a person who doesn't seem to have much patience. I use a smart board as part of my job and have to do screen calibration several times too, It's not perfect but it gets the job done.Thanks to the helpful tips that the previous reviewers of this tablet had written in their reviews, I use Skyfire, Slideme and other apps to make this tablet a far more useful one. I haven't gotten around to using the e-book reader that's includes because I still don't understand how to get e-books yet. The upcoming Kindle for Android is a BIG deal as I'd definitely would use it as soon as it's available.The wifi connection is pretty stable and good enough for everything I've done online. I haven't tried it on the road yet.My six year old already loves using the tablet to watch some movies and play some games. That's pretty good considering he has access to my PSP.Some cons: I know the tablet just came out but the tablet's Android OS is 1.5 which should be upgraded. I DEFINITELY think the tablet should be connected to the Android market so are you hearing this, Archos? There's no bag or protective covers out yet so I'm waiting for it. I also want to have a way to copy tv shows directly to the tablet as I can connect it to my HDTV via USB so far.If I can do all of the above in just a few days of owning this tablet then I'm impressed and am definitely keeping this tablet!", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK unit but touch screen is frustrating to use", "Author": "engineer user", "ReviewID": "R2NT7A77H15FT0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought the unit because of what you got for the price; however, got frustrated w/ the poor performance of the touch screen, and had to reset the unit a few times in order to start it, battery life was not as expected.

Hey!  This thing multitasks!! Take that, iPad!  And micro SD is so cheap!* the selection of Apps is limited by the hardware.  It's true that most Android apps are written for phones, which have control buttons, while the 7HT is controled completely from the touchscreen.* the Android version is outdated.

That's where product reviews come in and hopefully this one may help you make a decision.Let me start off by listing the good things I found about this product;- The Price: At $300 less than the cheapest Ipad the low price is probably the tablet's biggest selling point... and it's not like you'll have to give up a whole load of options to buy this.- Appearance; it looks cool (to me at least), the screen size is great and it FEELS nice. Make sure you carry a cleaning cloth to wipe away  all the smudges.- Nice multimedia options: you can read about the video/audio player/ web browser/ photo frame options above; I just want to make sure I mention that it  also comes with a nifty little ebook reader. Although not fantastic, these multimedia apps are quite decent and make this a good buy.- I'm going to say this as delicately as I can; I'm not saying you are BUT if you are the kind of person who prefers NOT to pay for your multimedia content (hint, hint, nudge, nudge), then this tablet is certainly right for you; I was impressed on how easy it was to transfer different types of movie, audio and text files (all perfectly legal, of course) and then getting to enjoy them moments later. See how long it would take you to do THAT on an Ipad!- Not enough storage space for all those files? How about this: a slot for a micro SD card! Still not enough? a USB port! I mean, really, how can you even think about offering a product like this WITHOUT even one of these options? Can you hear me, Apple?- Leg Stand; I'm being completely serious here. Even though it's cheap and plastic and will probably break off soon, I just love being able to prop up my tablet... in fact, add another half a star to my review!Looking good, eh? Now the BAD news;- Battery life? Not so good. Turns out that for some really weird reason it will wake up every couple of hours while you are sleeping and drain your battery. There are ways to reduce this drain but you cannot switch this feature off, ever...(pause for effect)... WHAT?!?!- I've heard a lot of good things about the Droid app market and about how it will eventually leave the Itunes version crying in the dust but I can't say I'm much impressed... I'm aware this tablet only offers a 'Light' version of the market but still, Itunes does not have much to worry about at this point.- The Touch Screen; ugh, what a nightmare. I spent half an hour the other day trying to download and install an app, knowing exactly what to do but being thwarted at every turn by this awful, awful system. And check this out: I decided to use it in bed and when I touched the screen, it stayed dark and one of the crappy songs that was included started playing with no way of turning it off! This machine has a mind of it's own and it apparently hates everybody. Anyone else find it ironic the Archos company is french?Good things, bad things, but is it worth buying?Let me put it this way: this is perfect for a teenager gets all his/her multimedia content from torrents and can it stuff into one of the pockets of his/her baggy slacker shorts. Anyone else? Hmmm, let's face it, you (and by you I mean we) would rather go with the Ipad and all the cool things an ipad entails... like how Apple products seem to just work...

use external keyboards/mice and storage devices (grab one of those roll-up keyboards for long emails/chat.+SD slotCons:-Battery life is nowhere near what Archos claims, medium or high brightness settings kill battery fast.  Screen brightness on low is perfectly fine for indoors, but nearly invisible under sunlight.-Requires a bit of user knowledge to get the most out of it - i.e. having to install rooted firmware to have access to the android market to get most apps.-Occasional lock-ups will require you to push pin-hole reset button-Wifi signal sometimes seems weaker than it should be for the distance.-FLACs dont play (at least not for me) with included music player, but other music player apps will play them (like Mixzing)Overall:I think the Archos 7 is a great option for people who want a very nice personal media player with some internet functions.  It's obviously not your top-of-the-line, decked out tablet with capacitive screen and camera and all that, but it does what it says it does, and, for the most part, does it well.A lot of the negative reviews that you'll read are either from people who own a V1 (they'll be the ones that complain about lack of accelerometer and slow performance with certain things) or from people who are unwilling to spend a couple minutes on google and do some reading on how to get the most out of this device.  Out of the box, the Archos 7 might only be a 3.5-4 star, but with rooted firmware installed and access to the android market and all the many apps on it, it's a solid 5 stars to me (well i'd knock off half a star for battery life exaggerations but i cant).  With this device, the more tech-savvy you are, the more you can get out of it, so the better value it is.Bottom line, if mine got lost or stolen, i'd buy another one.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned it same day", "Author": "Wayfinder", "ReviewID": "R2KWK9U8B7MAZH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Okay, I can't say this is a \"bad\" product... but I can only rate it one star.

My EVO 4G is way better than this and faster, additionally because of fragmentation in Android, Netflix streaming service is not going to work for a lot of Android devices.The app service is very limited, it doesn't use the Official Android store. I ended up buying my wife an iPad, I can't see how anybody can say this is even close to the functional level or quality of the iPad, it's not. It is way cheaper but a waste of your money, wait for Android 3.0 which will be made for the iPad experience.There is nothing with the ease of use, quality, and reliability of the iPad. This is a perfect fit for the old adage you get what you pay for.The Blackberry Playbook looks to be the closest competition, and HP/Palm is going to release a tablet as well early next year.

No hard reset, no amount of coaxing or cursing would make it come to life, so off it went back to the company for a fix/replacement.  In about a week or so we had a new unit, which my husband swears is a refurb.  This unit seems to lose the internet connection when the whim strikes (did not have this issue at all before).  So, here, are my pros/cons for this little unit....Pros: nice compact design, great to download my vacation photos and take to work or have with me, downloads music, plays movies, I can surf the net when my home computer is in use...perfect for me as I sit in bed.Cons: drops the internet connection for no reason that my techy sidekick husband or I can figure out, touch screen sometimes just sticks, though usually works ok.Overall if it worked consistently I would be happy with the unit, but I am often found cursing at the screen, so I give it a 3 star....I enjoy it when it works and when it doesn't, well, I have visions of a sledgehammer.....", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Android tablet? or high priced music player?", "Author": "Wix", "ReviewID": "R1UU6ZWVB2QE1E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Archos 8Gb Home Tablet is a promising product. However, I am sure people here aren't willing to dole out 200 dollars (more or less) based on potential only.A few of the really big drawbacks have been outlined here already. The Android Marketplace is unavailable and apps currently on the tablet are limited and kind of lame to be frank. To date, I have yet to successfully install Skyfire onto my tablet in order to use Adobe Flash 10 items such as Youtube videos even though I am usually more than capable of such tasks. (update 3/11 - I got Skyfire, then had to d/l youtube player from the marketplace. I now have youtube) Surfing is awkward. The product manual is lacking in detail and Archos leaves you to attempt to figure out way too much of this tablet, and not all of it is intuitive. The touch screen is responsive, yet sometimes clicks the wrong item or over/under responds to touch. A stylus isn't a bad idea.The battery life is good, the antenna for Wi-Fi is mediocre and hardly picks up reception in my house where my laptops perform with ease. The speakers are good and the screen resolution is satisfactory. The screen gets muddled up quite easily and requires constant wipedowns. Sometimes, the player wakes up for no reason and drains the battery!Some here have mentioned custom upgrades and firmware. These changes to your tablet can render it useless. I tried one and my tablet now hopelessly freezes everytime I allow it to power off, which causes me to have to redo the install, then lose all my data on the tablet. Not cool..One major flaw is the flimsy power and headphone jacks. I had to replace this item (shipping 10 dollars at my expense) after the power jack broke internally without warning. The plug does not completely insert into the jack and it appears it leaves the jack prone to being snapped off leaving you with no way to charge the tablet. It is not a problem that can easily be avoided so far as I can tell. As a result, my new Archos is perched on a table, not to be handled when it has items plugged into a port.Another negative is the inability to service or replace the battery in this device. So when the rechargable battery no longer functions you will be at the mercy of Archos to replace it, which will set you back 10 dollars for shipping to Archos plus repairs. A USB charger would have been a definate plus rather than relying on the wall outlet adapter.In conclusion, the Archos 8Gb HT is a sharp looking tablet which could have been executed so much better. At this price point I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere. In my opinion, the web surfing capabilities of this device have been hampered and do not justify recommending this as anything other than a high end mp3/video playback device.If you want an IPad like device RUN away from this one as you will be severely disappointed. I should also mention that I was given this item to review through Amazon's Vine program. If I am not happy with it- being given this for free in exchange for a review- then it speaks volumes to the quality of a product.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Idea, bad engineering", "Author": "Vinarian", "ReviewID": "RQISYD6FP79M2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "1. Touch Screen ***This is a touch screen ONLY device, the only hardware button is the power button. The touchscreen does however have good response for a restive (sp) screen. It is perfect for page turnswipes and taps. Initial configuration is a little finicky though, it took two tries to get calibrated.2. Storage ****Ok, so this is an 8gb device, but you can only read ebooks off of Android sd card, which makes no sense to me. However sd cards are dirt cheap nowadays, so that was not a huge problem. Not to mention that the 8gb can be used to store mp3s to listen to while reading...3. Battery Life ***** (outstanding!)(Wifi On and searching, but not connecting) The archos website touts 7 hours video and 44 hours music, I get about 6 hours video, but only 15 hours while just reading, so nowhere near eink, but a lot better than most other color screen devices. On the downside, the unit will NOT charge via usb, you must use the included multinational charger. Charge time is just over one hour.(Wifi on and connected)  When the wifi is connected to my home network, this device gets about 30 hours battery life for ereading - still about the same 6 hours for video though; I have not tested this device with wifi turned off yet.4. E-reader ****The device comes preinstalled wit Alkido which is an excellent ereader, though figuring out how to transfer. ebooks. may take a little getting used to. There ae great brightness settingsas well as nighttime color schemes for easy reading weather in bed or outside.5. Video & Music ***** (outstanding!)This is really where archose shines, The multimedia functions of this device are outstanding -- not to mention as i stated before, 6 hours of battery life for video - this is perfect for a plane ride, or even to catch up on newsclips on the commute (metro ride!) to work.  The speakers are excellent for being such a small device, very nice, crisp and loud - at least for video, slightly better quality than many laptops i have used.  For music I would reccomend headphones.6. Operating System **This device uses android 1.5 - and not the full version, the app store is not included, though a bastardized version run by archose is, what this means is that 90% of android apps will NOT install automatically, including Opera and Skyfire.  There are a few websites around that offer alternatives to android market of which about 75% of the apps that i have tried on the alternative sites will work.  Even in the archose supported Apps Lib, there are still some (mostly games) that will not run correctly on this device.  There are some major memory issues with the operating system - it is ESSENTIAL that some sort of memory management app is installed such as \"kill\" which will allow running apps to be stopped on the fly as there is no native way to end a program that is running.  There are also some programs that will store (temporary?) data in the app space of the archos which is only about 20 megs to begin with, such as the app \"funny joke\" (installable from apps lib) which after a while will have built up a 6+ megs cache which makes the unit incredably slow (the ereader will crash due to not enough memory at this point) untill the user enters the settings screen and deletes the cache for the funny jokes app - which can be a pain, especially when the device is already slow...7. Design ***While this device seems to be designed fairly well, there are two large flaws -- 1.) this unit CANNOT be charged via USB, you MUST use the included wall adapter, and 2.) the headphone jack and the power adapter plug are the same size - i shorted out the headphone jack the day i received the device by plugging the power into the unmarked headphone jack by mistake.  It would not have been difficult to include a different sized power jack...8. Durability **After 1 month of using the Archos, it will occasionally die and need to be reset (there is a reset button on the back if you have a pin or needle), not a huge problem, just more annoying than anything else, this seems to happen when the screen will automatically turn off sometimes when the feature is engaged - probably about 10% of the time the screen auto turns off.  The power switch will sometimes get activated without touching it, causing the Shutdown screen to display repeatedly untill the device is reset (happened 5 times to me now)Overall, I would rate this product 3 stars -- For a company that built such a good device, there are some fatal flaws that should have been resolved before release such as the shoddy engineering on the durability of the device as well as support for android 2.0 at the very least - if it would cost more money, I would have happily pad an extra $50-100 for a better product.To sum up -- this is a cheaply priced Devuce, if  you dont want to spend to much monney, this device is great, but you do get what you pay for!", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "It is what it is....", "Author": "Kelly L.

All in all this unit works best if you see it as a video-music player with some light web browsing possible.Pros: Light weight, good battery life, enough applications that you can probably find what you need with a little searching, ok performance, not subject to a complete lock down like Apple products.Cons: Android takes a bit of time to learn to use (if you haven't used it before), the screen is not as clear as more expensive Archos products and is subject to the quirks of being a resistive screen, Android 1.5 and the lack of the Android Market makes you work a bit to find applications, like every Archos product I have owned expect some strangeness - occasional shut-downs, slow to update, things of that nature.All in all it may sound like I am down on this unit but for the price it really is a great Jack Of All trades and unlike people who buy an expensive iPad and have to deal with it being outdated when the next version is introduced, the cost of this makes it easy to upgrade.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Louise Murphy", "ReviewID": "R1JDEKAQ9LJNH6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We were disappointed with the Archos 7.

There are two music players on it, the better of which does not contain a random play/shuffle. The screen calibration never seems to calibrate correctly. The wi-fi is glitchy at best, dropping connection at random. The built in app store is not the default android marketplace but a custom built Archos exclusive which results in a lot of android apps not being available to the Archos tablet. The sleep doesn't function properly on it, either refusing to go to sleep or waking randomly and startlingly, sucking the battery dry. The only real way to conserve the battery is to turn it off.

The first unit I received wouldn't calibrate although I was able to use it some.  It got worse over the next 48 hours so I asked Amazon for a replacement unit and had it the next morning.If you buy one, do a firmware upgrade from the Archos site after charging the battery and initializing.  It improves the battery life a lot!  As everyone noted, it doesn't have the Google Market app, but I haven't cared yet.  Everything I've wanted to download has been available somewhere on the web.  There are also several other web sites that offer library apps.I downloaded Google docs which works like a charm.  I downloaded Skyfire to get flash capability.  I downloaded Astrid to get a to-do list that syncs with Remember the Milk.The pre-installed apps work very well.  I have about 50 ebooks loaded into Aldiko.  I also have about 20 videos and about 4 gig of music loaded.  On the Archos 7ht user forum I downloaded AppManager and Advanced Task Manager.  ATM also acts as a task killer so there's no reason to have a separate app for that.When you attach the USB cable to your pc, you get a device called Archos 7.  If you also have an installed SD card, you get another device with only a letter identifier.  They work well enough that I never remove the micro SD card.There are times that the touch screen is difficult to use.  I've kept a 3-color ballpoint pen with one ink barrel replaced with a stylus for years.  When I use it to navigate, I get a lot of precision and don't have to press very hard.  I don't use it at all for basic music playing, video watching, ebook reading, etc.  Just on apps that have a lot of data in small areas.There aren't enough business apps available yet, but that's an Android issue, not an Archos one.  I'd love to see an outline note taker, but it just doesn't exist yet.

I would not suggest this product as your first computer or even your WiFi connected gadget.  You have to be able to figure out how to problem solve because this product is not as consumer friendly as an IPad.  It runs the Android Operating System 1.5.  If you don't know what that means, then I suggest you look for a product with a more familiar OS.  Won't play CNN or Youtube movies.  No camera, No G3. WiFi only.  It's not the fastest machine out there.  As a matter of fact, it's a bit on the slow side, so don't expect too much from this 7 inch tablet.Next I suggest you read a little bit about the product and its limitations.Now the good.  It plays videos really well and they look very good on the screen.  If you want to play home movies on the tab, I suggest you bump up the color saturation, but for most Hollywood movies they will look very good.  I play mostly divx encoded AVI movies.  Photos too need a bit more saturation to look good on the tab, but once you find the right amount, the photos look really good. Web browsing is fairly fast and most websites load properly.  I mostly use the tablet to read forums and read articles off of the internet.  The 7 HT is a really good ebook reader. It will display any non DRM epub book, so if you like to read the classics, there are a lot of books that you can download off of the internet for free.  The ebook really was a nice surprise.  It can also stream music with an app called Deezer. The speakers are just adequate for listening, but the 7HT has an earphone jack.The 7HT is a really nice machine if you can live with a couple of limitations.  One thing I could live with is the price.  It is $360.00 less than the cheapest IPad, and it will do about 90% of what an IPad can do.  Cruising the internet is fast and relatively easy with the 7HT and I find it to be the right tablet for me.

But using this tablet has been nothing but an exercise in frustration.  First, it's running Android 1.5 and 3.0 is out on devices now.  Second, the touch screen is SLOW in response and often I get no response.  Now I know that's because it's a cheaper resistive touch screen.  It drops the wifi connection over and over and I have to reset the device to get the connection back.The real kicker is that it does not use the normal Android market.  You have to use the Archos market and there are, of course, a limited amount of apps in their market.  I've also had it freeze up a number of times and was unable to get it working until I reset it, just like with wifi going bad.I spent a few hours one night just trying to configure this, add a few apps, and change some settings and, due to the poor touch screen, found it almost impossible to get anything done on this tablet.  I can't think of any use this tablet would work as, other than, perhaps, a display that doesn't need to be interactive.

E-mail works, set up imap accounts very easily.  Seamlessly connects to PC without issues.  I'm running XP, didn't have to install anything, it just showed up as two drives, one for the tablet and one for the SD card.  Touch screen is not overly bright, very easy to see.  Very light weight, easy to carry, battery easily lasts a day without constant use.  Much easier to browse web pages with a bigger screen than with a phone.  These are the reasons I bought this tablet, so I can't complain much.Cons:  No WPA Enterprise encryption support, cannot connect to university wifi.  Android 1.5, problematic, will not work with most .apk files I try to download.  No easy way to upgrade it to newer version of android, some custom roms exist, but don't work 100%.  If anyone has found one, please let me know.  No flash support, no youtube app.  New version of Skyfire won't install which gives flash support, have to use old version.Other thoughts:  None of the cons listed would have made me not buy this thing for about $40 less than what it was listed for on here (found one on Craigslist).  It is really good for what it is, basically a portable internet/media browser to use in your home (I assume this is why they call it a HOME tablet).  If you buy it for these things, it's great, not going to deduct anymore than 1 star for not being able to easily hack the thing to death, and install all sorts of custom stuff.EDIT:  I did find a custom ROM for this that works nicely.  Can be found at wiki dot archosfans dot com, title of wiki is \"Archos 7HT Firmware Himself V0.27 SamJr YAR!\".  0.28 Version is good, but need to install it exactly how it tells you using RKAndroid.

So beware if you think you're gonna be able to hook up this thing to your tv and watch videos, is not gonna happen. Anyways, I'm still keeping it cause it does all the other things I was looking for. It's a light, easy, portable way of surfing the internet around the house plus the music and being able to watch videos on the go on a 6 inch wide screen for $200 dollars made this a little neat handy device that I must keep. Ok, now for the review:1) You should know that the default keyboard is impossible to use because when you press a letter any letter around THAT letter is pressed but the one you pressed... got it? It doesn't click where you click... but you can download an app with a different keyboard with bigger keys and problem solved.2) You should also know that there is not a single internet browser (from the ones that are available to download plus the default browser) where you can watch flash sites or any kind of flash content on this device, the ONLY browser that allows you to play videos in flash format (only videos-you won't be able to see ads or content in flash format) it's called Skyfire and it ONLY works with some websites. If you visit a website with flash content you will see a gray screen, gray square, rectangle or whatever instead of the flash format. If there is a video in flash format on that website and Skyfire is able to detect it you will get a pop-up window were you can click play and watch that video. For all other purposes the Skyfire browser is very slow and crashes too many times but... is still in beta mode so maybe this will change, but for now, no flash, no flash, no flash. But if you're looking to watch youtube videos, Skyfire will work just fine and better than any other youtube applications, so that's a good thing, and for any other purpose the default browser works just fine and is the fastest.3) You should also know that the battery lasts forever (well not forever but about 6 hours of constant use), I use my tablet all day long surfing the internet, checking my e-mail 100 times per day, downloading files and videos through out the day and at the end of the day I still have about 30% battery left. Nothing like most cellphones that you have to keep loading the battery every day; and if you don't use it as often as I do you wont have to load maybe in 2 - 3 days. Is the best feature of this device.4) Finally, you should also know that this device has Android 1.5 and that there's already a 1.6 and 2.0/2.1 versions and that \"maybe\" we will NEVER see an update to one of this newer versions from Archos unless someone at the archosfans forum creates a hack for it allowing the Android updates; something they have already done for the Android Market which you can't access from this device... but now we can, so there IS access to Android Market on this device... another good thing, and that's all.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lovely toy", "Author": "wondershovel", "ReviewID": "R1QZW8HMR5LU1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't know if it can run every modern whiz-bang Android app but this tablet has a wonderful bright LCD screen perfect for showing off pictures and browsing the net.

I say this with all honesty of what I would of wanted to know before I bought the Archos.

This is the first review I have ever submitted, it takes a HUGE amount of good or bad to overtake my laziness and put the effort into writing a review. And I do so you don't have to realize after the initial 2 hour playtime we do with all neat gadgets, that you have just waisted whatever amount of money you put in to this. I paid 80 on Craigslist and still feel took..Basically all apps available are made for phones, thus they are phone size in the corner of the 7inch screen, video is scarce at best and quality of video is VHS. Games are of  a 2003 cell phone..So trying to find a use for it, I figure maybe an internet browser and I can use it to stumble through all nonpictured websites, but I would usually get tired of waiting or force closing and just pull out the phone to look up in less time.. I originally was shopping for another Sony Dash to watch Netflix with, as the Dash is fairly cheap and works for what I need, the Archos looked neater and I got it. I am okay with buying something that doesn't do what I thought or these days I am even getting use to something being poor quality and just not buying this brand name again. But I was to the point where I couldn't find anything to do with it, a stupid picture viewer would be fine even, but the quality was pretty poor. and this may just be mine, but the screen just turns on by itself all the time, forcing me to shut it all the way off and not wanting to take the turn on time, it just sits off, until I try to find an app or something to put it to use.This product seems like it was intended to be decent, and was forgot about.

There are custom firmwares, how tos and what not.But I did not do any of that. I am using it unmodded and am quite happy with the functionality. Out of the box, it gives you the ability to read your emails, surf the net, read books, read news from all over the world, chat with your MSN and yahoo messenger friends, play music or videos from the 32GB SD card or 8GB memory. A light weight device with a 7 inch screen that can do all that in itself is a pretty good value at the price mentioned. Key word is portability. Much better than lugging your laptop around. Oh and the battery on this thing seems to last forever.The ALDIKO reader that comes bundled with it allows you to download lots of free books to your device. Not only that, it allows you to add a custom catalogue to your device - such as [...] which lets you download thousands of free public domain books including those by Dickens and my personal favorites - P.G. Wodehouse and H.Rider Haggard.Now what else can you do with it ? As it turns out - PLENTY. But first delete, not update, but delete the appslib that comes bundled with it and reinstall the new appslib from [...]/latest.0. Taskiller app from appslib. Put it on the main screen (by tapping and holding just like iphone) and now you can actually kill apps that are running in the background and free up memory. If you kill all apps except the taskiller, it also solves the problem of frequent unexpected wake from sleep cycles that drain battery.1. Remote VNC and RDP clients - two apps available from appslib lets you control all the PCs or Laptops from your archos 7 device. For using the RDP client you will need to enable remote access on your PCs and for using the VNC client you will have to install something like tightVNC on your PCs/laptops.2. Youtube - That is right. There is a youtube version 1.3 APK available on the net which installs a youtube application on your archos 7 device. Version 1.3 was the last Cupcake (Android 1.5) compatible version of youtube. Regrettably, the myAccount feature in the app does not work. So your personal favorites, playlists etc are inaccessible but you can still search and play.3. Facebook - You can download a facebook app from appslib. There are more than one available. So take your pick.4. PANDROA - Well not really. I could not find PANDORA per se but from appslib you can download an application called SLACKER. Same concept as Pandora but better implementation. My favorite feature in this app is a predefined HITS section which has several predefined radio stations - Current hits, Love songs, hits from the 80s, 70, 60s, 50s, Country and others. It even has international stations.5. ES FILE EXPLORER - Search for it on the net. It lets you access files from all the network shares on your home network. Which means all your media, audio or video, is just a flick of a finger away. The current version of this software has some limitations. When playing audio files it does not automatically move on to the next audio file and when playing video, it actually transfers the entire video to the internal memory instead of streaming it.6. Skyfire browser - Search for it on the net. This browser lets you play embedded FLASH videos on websites such as MSN.com.7. Sleeptimer - Search for it on the net. This application, as the name suggests, lets you specify a time after which it will shut down the audio player. So if you like going to sleep while listening to your favorite melody..this is the application for you. Just a word of caution - It lets your turn off WIFI when it goes to sleep - DON'T DO IT - because then the wifi stops working altogether. I had to do a factory reset and load everything all over again.8. An application that produces white noise - ocean sounds, rain sounds, fan sounds and a dozen other to help some of you light sleepers fall asleep. Search appslib for the word \"sleep\" and you will find a bunch of these.9. The photo frame app that comes bundled with it can be used to endlessly slideshow your pictures, while the audio player is playing your favorite music.I am sure you can find many more uses for it and many more cool applications from appslib. This is all i have been able to do in my 2 weeks of owning this tablet and needless to say i am 100 % satisfied with it.PS - Check out Andromote (on the device) and XBMC (on the pc) combination also.

But because of the really cheap price, I still considered getting one.I work as a stage and rigging supervisor and we do outdoor stages and roofing system here in the Philippines. This is my 2nd touchscreen device, my first was a Garmin Nuvi 1410 GPS and I would say that the screen responsiveness of archos 7 is just similar to garmin GPS.I mainly use this thing for viewing photos, pdfs, sometimes as an audio player/ online radio, browsing the web (when I'm too lazy to switch on my mac desktop), and to watch youtube movies.PROS:1. Great photo viewer to show clients plans, designs, proposals, and old stage setups.2. Very handy during stage setups. It serves as the bluprint of our stage design that I follow and it becomes the checklist of things I need to finish.3. Fits in my back pocket because of its slim design.4. The item seems solid and rugged. For me, you don't have to be very careful on this device. This can handle itself with bumps, scratches that it experiences during my rugged stage setups.I dropped this thing once during a setup, It hit a steel truss then fell on a concrete ground about 3 feet high and its still working fine. If it breaks, I don't mind, I'll get another one. Its very cheap not like the iPad or galaxy tab.5. Great for watching Youtube (you need to download a modified youtube app to make it work), great for HD 720p movies. Accepts divx, mkv, avi, and almost any format I throw into it.6. Touchscreen is not as sensitive as an iPad or any capacitive touchscreens but surprisingly responsive. Maybe its because of my big and heavy hands. My sister hates this thing cause she's used to her iPad's too sensitive touch. I sometimes I use the other end of my ballpen as a stylus and its pretty responsive. But this thing works for me.7. I love the micro SD card expansion. I can expand its capacity up to 40gb8. Battery life is longer than I expected as long as you turn the wifi off.CONS:1. Slow on 3d games but not really a big issue for me. I have another dedicated device for 3d gaming2. The kickstand wiggles and feels very cheap.3. weak wifi signal strength you need to be near the wireless router to get great wifi connection.4. Does not charge via micro USB port so you have to bring the dedicated charger most of the time.5. Very crappy earphones included.6. Randomly restarts. it just happened now while I'm writing this review. This was the 2nd time it restarted by itself. the first time was when I dropped it.7. No bluetooth tethering with my phone. I wish it had a bluetooth so I may connect online using my phone anywhere I am. But, as the name suggests, it is a HOME tablet. you can get the Archos 70 tablet with bluetooth but at twice the price of this.All in all, a really great product for what it does. For only $149.00, It does almost anything I need it to do. Oh, by the way, this is the Archos 7 Home Tablet Version 2, The one with Android Eclair installed, not the cupcake 1.5 version.

I decided to get it set up and mess around with it a bit in advance of Christmas to avoid frustration on the day and was pretty pleased with what I found. The native Internet browser was pretty speedy and the sample video and music provided looked and sounded great. The apps that the company said were preloaded were there, but hidden in the Files section, but loaded with a couple of clicks -- an eBook reader with access to hundreds of free classic books, a radio service, an e-mail service that I didn't try yet, all loaded with a click or two.The official app library was there too and lets you view top apps and search for specific apps and download directly the Android apps they provide. I downloaded VideoBox, which lets you stream and download YouTube videos (worked pretty well once I figured out I could search it -- you can stream or download to view later, downloading was a bit slow).  There are tons of other apps on the Archos AppLibrary, but you can get others that it doesn't have from other sites. The Skyfire browser, which lets you view streaming video from other sites (though sadly not Hulu), was downloaded to my Mac from PandaApps, then transferred to the Archos with the provided USB cord in just a couple minutes. I was able to watch an episode of a TV show on the CW's website with no lag.  A Quicktime movie file I had on my Mac transferred easily -- just drag and drop, then open from Archos Files, and looked great.I also took the advice on tech reviews and downloaded a task killer to shut down apps not being used to keep browsing fast. All in all, a pretty good little device -- I work online and was able to access my work site and type easily on the on-screen keyboard, though it says you can attach one via USB. The touch screen worked pretty well, it calibrates on initial start-up, the only frustration is when scrolling down, it clicks on the items you're scrolling through instead, so took a few tries to get to what I was looking for on occassion -- a small price to pay.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Second unit purchase of Archos 7 Home Tablet", "Author": "R.

Everyone is wired(less) anymore and yet another screen that does the same thing as every other screen seems frivolous.  Considering I don't own a gadget that runs any kind of an app, I was curious if the tablet is even worth playing with. -Eventually after I was able to grab some WiFi I enjoyed what the limited but sleek and handsome Archos had to offer.  Most exciting to me was the idea of an Ereader while Aldiko is built in and you can grab some great old public domain material this thing isn't exactly the answer to the Kindle, plus a backlight screen that kind of flashed a little on the lowest light setting left me wanting more.  Next up the apps I barely know an app from an apple but I like games, and there are some fun free titles to be found on the service the squashing games seem to work best with this units inability to run many of the tilt driven games. digital music plays well on this unit and it plays FLAC files perfectly (a big plus for me).  The video looks spectacular but given the units somewhat limited intial memory  you will be deleting and transfering alot unit you grab a miniSD card.  The power on button stinks it took me a week to figure it out properly and the manual and documentation are kind of a why bother.  The ac jack and headphone jack are too close and can be confused for one another without close inspection.  GREAT SCREEN< BATTERY LIFE< CODECS seem to play every audio and video file I throw at it.  The browser works well and websites look great but I would use it only in situations where it was the only option.  The price is right and the screen is a beauty.

Right away I had a hard time with the touch screen, it would highlight something that I wasn't even close to or scroll through things way too fast.  I thought it was just because I wasn't used to it, but it never did get better.I tried some of the preloaded apps first.  I didn't like the email app because it seemed like I could only delete the emails after I opened them, maybe there is a way around this that I don't know about, but it was annoying.  I get a good amount of junk mail and just wanted to delete it right from the inbox without opening the emails themselves.I tried the ebook app second, tried to search for some books that might interest me, but it just seemed to be book and writers I've never heard of.Tried getting on the web, this worked ok except one site I frequent uses Java and it was not installed, nor do I know if it's even possible to install on this.

Archos' version of Android 1.5 is a bit weak compared to 1.6 or 2.0. No Google Apps support, but you can still get 75% of available apps through other sources. Members of ArchosFans.com have developed \"unofficial\" OS builds that support Google Apps, but this voids the warranty.I got it to play videos and music, and it has not disappointed. The 7\" screen is heaven when compared to the Apple Touch (and it plays downloaded Flash videos). Battery seemingly lasts forever (not really, but I can spend the day watching videos, jam to mp3's, check my email 100x a day, do a bit of surfing and still have 30% battery power left).Wi-Fi connectivity is easy, so is email setup. I found the just released Opera Mini 5 does a far better job for both surfing and email, and you can sync data with your Opera desktop browser. Wi-Fi search is comprehensive, and if you have a home network it does a great job linking to it. You can map shared drives for file transfer (does not stream data)!Expansion is limited to microSD cards (max 32GB). Limit you app/email/e-book/etc collection until you get the additional SD card (get several if you can, it's easy to just keep adding music/videos/photos and data). Besides the case, accessories are wanting - nothing, zippo! USB cable (A to B) is file transfer only. Battery charging is by adapter only (although you can buy the USB charger for the Archos 3G and charge through desktop/laptop USB).Software is a bit wanting, as I mentioned. The Archos uses AppsLib (be careful as most developers do not provide details about their apps), do a Google search to get additional info before installation. Installed apps include: Aldiko (e-books), Alarm Clock, Calculator, Email, ColorNotes (notepad), generic Video Player, Photo Viewer, Audio Player, Sound Recorder, and Music (jukebox), and finally the crummy browser. Besides the App Window, there is also a 3-panel Homepage allowing plenty of room to layout your \"desktops\"!I guess my biggest complaint is the touchscreen. It a resistive screen, and calibration takes a lot of finesse! Take you time, try applying different pressures. If you get incorrect launches, or incorrect letters when typing, re-calibrate.Overall, it's a very nice product. It wasn't meant to replace your laptop. You need to understand what it does, and what it does not. Be weary of \"puffing\" sellers, go to [...] to get accurate info. Like any relationship you want to last, it takes time to get used to each other. Besides the cash, invest some time, the rewards are worth it.If you need something more robust and expandable, wait a few months more. Should be a slew of rollouts for more muscular tablets.

I also suggest going into the forums (archosfans.com) and read what even the fans have to say about it.First, it's a very good looking product.  I love how it looks and feels.  The price point is great too.  If it could do everything it's supposed to do, it would be a steal. Unfortunately, it does not.1) Video - I mainly use my Archos products to watch videos.  With a family of six, including several video game players, it's hard to get any time on the TV.  So I use my portable devices to catch up on my favorite shows.  The Archos 7 could not handle most of the videos I threw at it.  THe video was choppy and dropped frames.  The audio stuttered. These were simple AVI files previous Archos players had no trouble playing.  I re-encoded one video and it did better but it took about 45 min to encode.  (One annoying thing is I haven't figured out how to delete a video directly from the device.  You have to plug it in to your PC and delete from there.  The user manual is very sketchy and of little help for any of the troubleshooting.)2) Resistive touch screen - lots of reviewers have commented on this.  Unfortunatley it's true.  It's not very good.  If you're used to an iPod you'll be very frustrated very quickly.  Just scrolling down through videos was a hassle.3) Unexpected Wake from Suspend - this is a serious flaw.  The fact that it wasn't fixed with a firmware upgrade is very disappointing.  I should be able to suspend my unit and not have it wake up every couple of hours to drain my battery.4) Android 1.5 - the unit is using an earlier version of Droid.  Most the apps you want to get won't even run on this unit.  The appslib won't even connect.  I installed a few apps by downloading them directly from the internet.  Others I tried installing wouldn't work.  One said \"not enough memory to install app.\"  What a ridiculous error message, considering it's a brand new product and I had nothing on the unit yet.5) Surfing the internet is slow and frustrating. I'm comparing it to how quickly my iPod loads pages.  I would never use the unit for internet, which eliminates a lot of its functionality.Amazon is no longer selling this unit. That should be a HUGE clue. I expect they are getting a lot of returns.  Mine is going back for sure.  I'll wait for the Archos 8 or find some other product.  I haven't lost complete faith in the company, but this product is terrible.  I wanted to love it too.  It might be the first time I was truly surprised at Christmas.

Bad choice. It's definitely not for the mainstream user. It's quiet buggy and there are rough edges all over the software. No doubt, it plays several formats of video and audio but that doesn't redeem its other shortcomings. There is no excuse for the lack of a capacitative touch screen. One has to constantly keep calibrating it, and even then, it's impossible to accurately select what one intends to.This is a definite demonstration of how companies take customers back several years with each new generation of device, instead of releasing mature, robust products. This kind of thing immediately obsoletes all previous investments in software, accessories and more importantly, data. I'm not even going to mention the customization and familiarity that one grows into to use gadgets effectively and smoothly.Back to the A7HT... here, I have a \"new\" device, with an already aging OS (Android ver 1.5), and outdated hardware and little that can be done to customize and \"improve\" it otherwise, because most new(er) Android applications don't work on it. Add to that Android is tuned for mobile phone type devices with a different form-factor and functionality. Bad choice, Archos!Some things do work though... the browser is ok, email has IMAP support... and the video and music. But there is no native streaming support (other than via the internet... no uPnP or shared file systems). The pathetic 8GB memory compounds the problem (of the lack of streaming support).People go gaga over the screen. But not so fast, people. It's barely adequate and totally inadequate for viewing photographs; it's like those old color monitors from the 80s - patchy and blotched. The sound... my 5 year old iPod shuffle is soooooo much better.It does work well as an eBook reader, but there is no Kindle support (probably resulting from the older Android version).People say that's what one should expect for USD 199.

I did some research on Archos' website, and read some reviews here, and decided to purchase it.  It came quick from Amazon as always.  I opened the box up, turned it on, and was really impressed with the picture quality.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing to impress.Where to start:The Archos 7, has a 7 inch screen, which displays a great picture, but 7 inches is a little smaller than you might think it is, especially if your doing a lot of internet surfing.  The touch screen, which unfortunately is resistive, is a HUGE disappointment.  I understand that it keeps the cost down, but with everything moving to capacitive, it's really a let down.  You have to push the screen really hard to make a selection, and even then its hard to make a pin-point selection, i.e. a link on website.  It's very hard to scroll via a finger swipe, and I can't tell you how many times I clicked something I did not mean to click.  I knew when I ordered the Archos that it had the resistive touch screen, and I thought it wouldn't make much of a difference, but it makes a huge difference!  I think it has a 600mhz processor, which does ok, but once you start multi-tasking it gets bogged down rather quickly.  The virtual keyboard is OK, but again, with the resistive touchscreen, it is very difficult and SLOW to type something.  Also lacking on the Archos is the Android operating system it runs on.  Archos ships these units with Android 1.5, which is becoming a relic with 2.1 already out, and 2.2 around the corner.  I havn't heard anything about an update coming for the Archos, but it would be a lot better if they upgraded to the newer firmware.  Also lacking, is access to the android apps store.  Instead this unit ships with Archos' version of an app store called AppsLib.  It has a fraction of the apps that the android store has.  There is also no Youtube, app, and Flash is not supported in the 1.5 version of Android, so you cannot watch Youtube, or any other flash videos for that matter.That being said, the resolution on the Archos 7 screen is pretty stellar, videos and websites look great, as do mobile books and pictures.  The battery life is pretty good as well(and could only stand to get better with an operating system update), lasting about 7hrs with light use.  It also sports a kickstand, and mini sd card slot, along with a usp port(all be it mini usb), which even the Ipad doesn't have.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the good does not outway the bad in this case.To put it simply, if you want something you can surf basic webpage's with, read mobile books, and watch movies on the fly, for $200 this device might be good for you.  On the other hand, if you went to see an Ipad, but thought you would find an Android alternative, it may be too soon, and the Archos 7 just can't match up.  I would suggest waiting for the Dell Streak, or one of the many other Android tablets coming out this year.

It is a great price. You can buy the external keyboard at the web site.  I can only give it two stars. I bought the Archos 7 Home tablet to play You Tube videos to use at the gym for when I perform my cardio work outs. I figure that all tablets had an available flash player.  Much to my chagrin, the Archos 7 Home tablet does not play You Tube videos. The Archos 7 Home tablet does not have a support for the Flash Player. This means that CNN, and Amazon vides or any videos from the Web will not play on the tabletl.  The app that is available for the Archos 7 Home tablet, just for You Tube videos, is grainy and has a very small viewing window. I deleted the app. The WI FI app that is available does pick up on the wireless networks at Union Station Washington DC, but does pick up on the wireless networks in the library. I have down loaded two of the Wi Fi and both failed. I deleted both of them.  The touch screen is tricky at best and the Archos 7 Home tablet has shut down on me numerous times and had to be recalibrated.  In order to play the You Tube videos, I have to down load the videos and save them, convert them to a .mp4 format and then load them in to the tablet! I had to convert over 13 GB of videos. That meant I had to install convertor software to accomplish this. This was more steps and additional software on my PC. This is NOT why I bought a tablet! Please, do your home work! If you want a tablet that plays videos and connects to available WiFi networks this is not the tablet for you. I have to admit that the video play back is excellent.  The eReader is a tad off. I was reading the `Invisible Man' and moved to the next screen. I realized that the sentences did not match. I had to turn the Archos 7 Home tablet vertical and could see that five sentences were skipped when it was horizontal positon. So, I moved to the next page while the Archos 7 Home tablet was in the horizontal position and I realized that a hyphenated word was skipped. So then, I had to turn the Archos 7 Home tablet to a vertical position. I had t keep turning the Archos 7 Home tablet vertical and horizontal until I finished my first H.G. Wells novel and I have not used the eReader again.  The Archos 7 Home tablet manual reads that it has 7 hours video play and that is not true. The video play back is just over three hours before the warning to recharge the battery. I have two and half hour one-way daily commute and I have to charge the battery when I get to work and when I get home. What is scary is how HOT the battery gets when charging and while the videos play.The plastic kickstand only works in the horizontal position. It looks and feels breakable. I do not use it.If you are a gadget-freak this is not he tablet for you.  I am now shopping for a tablet with the features I need. Hopefully, I will find one in the $400 range.

As you've been reading, the screen is very unresponsive. This makes typing tricky, you have to type one key at a time, like typing into an old typewriter. I'm not sure if its the screen or the processor, but scrolling on webpages is also sluggish. Even after the firmware update, the browser crashed really frequently. Because scrolling locks up so frequently, attempts at scrolling registers as a tap and you will unintentionally click on links. Because of this, I nearly formatted my micro-SD card.The photo viewer can take up to 30 seconds to load all the photo icons viewable in one page- this is pretty slow and makes it unusable. I'd say a 1/3 of the time when trying to open a photo (5 mp) it crashed. When it finally opened my photos, flipping from photo to photo was relatively smooth.I purchased this mainly as a pdf reader since my phone is too small to read off of. It does have the ability to read pdf's, though not well. The available pdf reader apps from the appslib store (all that you can use rather than the android market) are the worst available. Only 1 pdf reader functioned correctly, and it was only able to read pdf's when opened from the browser. To date, Adobe's reader cannot work on the device, and won't install even if you track down the installation file.The email app works well, whoop-di-doo. So do a few board game apps. Other things you don't care about- its the perfect size for switching between holding in your hand or reading on your lap.Movies and mp3's play really well- HD video (in whatever format the files are when you download them straight from youtube) played perfectly and smoothly (but there is no flash support, so don't think about watching videos on youtube). The colors are great and there is no glare, although I did notice the solid-color background flicker when playing solitaire.

It features 8 Mb internal memory, microSD card capability, a beautiful screen, and the Android operating system. It lacks access to the full Android marketplace, has some odd design elements, and (in my experience) has a few quality issues. The device is worth the cost, if it fits your needs.If you want more details, read on!----------I was excited to get this \"home tablet\". It is advertised as being suitable for a person who does not want the inconvenience of a PC / laptop, but needs more than a iPod or other small mobile device.Design:The device is made in France, and it shows in the design elements. It is beautifully made, with a satin steel backing, a large 7 inch wide-aspect screen (720p HD capable), and glossy plastic that somehow does NOT show fingerprints. However it also has some features that may be a bit odd to American consumers. For example, the device charges with a red light, but when charged the light turns YELLOW, not green as one would expect.Archos decided to use a custom USB port, even though there is ample room for a standard mini-USB port. Perhaps it would have spoiled the look of the device. Whatever the reason, a standard port would have made replacing the cable easier.The power system has some odd quirks. The supplied small power unit (with multi-national plugs) fits perfectly into the top round port on the side of the device. Unfortunately, that port is for the earphones! The power port is below the earphone opening; this works fine, but the power plug only goes in about 2/3 of the way, and falls out easily. When plugged in, the device powers on, instead of requiring the user to switch it on. I suppose this is useful in some cases, but it was annoying when all I wanted to do was charge the device - I had to wait for it to power up (about 20 seconds) before I could power it down!Speaking of the earphone port, the included earphones work well and sound nice, but the length of the lines after they split off of the main wire is very short. The wires actually press into my throat a bit, and are almost too short to use. I would expect to buy an aftermarket headphone for this model.The dual built in speakers are barely adequate, and I found them to sound somewhat tinny. OK for most uses, but not spectacular.The device has a support stand to allow it to be propped up for viewing - using one leg. This is not terribly stable, and since the single leg is on the opposite side from the \"menu\" area of the device (upper right corner), it is pretty easy to have the unit come down smartly onto the table or whatever. Caution is advised when using it vertically.The top of the unit sports an on-off-screen lock slide switch which is SHARP, and I don't mean nice looking. It comes to a point on the edge that the user will push, and is uncomfortable to use. There is an indent in the middle of the switch, so those people with fingernails will want to use it that way. Otherwise, be prepared for discomfort when sliding the switch either on or off (the switch has to be held against the force of the spring to function). Right next to the switch is the opening for the MicroSD card. When fully inserted, the card extends about 1/16 of an inch - just enough to make one hit that instead of the power switch. I have no idea why they didn't make it flush with the top surface.The unit gets a bit hot on the bottom when charging, which you will do pretty often - I found the battery to last about 2 hours in most circumstances. You could listen to a lot of music if you switch off the screen, which consumes a lot of power. It gets a bit hot underneath when the unit is charging, a bit less hot when it is running, but nothing too uncomfortable.The device has a resistive screen, which means that one has to push a bit hard to get a response. This is as opposed to the capacitive screen found in the iPhone, for example, which is requires less effort. I found that I had to swipe my finger a couple of times on many occasions to get a response. I don't know if this is due to slow computer response or the screen. It is sufficient for the needs of the device, but may bother some people.The documentation was VERY minimal, just a few pages with some of the basics. It came nowhere near explaining how to use most of the features of the device.Functionality:The device runs Android, which is a Linux derived OS. It works well, but for someone coming from a Windows environment it will take some time to get used to. The home screen has three \"windows\" for holding icons; one swipes the finger left and right to go between screens. A small tab slides out to reveal the applications installed.It plays media files well and synchronizes with the latest Windows Media player - so if you use the media player on your PC, your files will be transferred when you sync.The web browser is a custom built offshoot of Google Chrome, and works OK but is a bit basic. I liked the way they offered a multi-window view of open pages.The device includes access to the Archos \"Applib\", which has maybe 500 applications, and has a number of good games available for download, all free. Other applications are available but not as useful - they are pretty specific in nature. Some of the news programs were interesting, but one can get the same news (and more) off the Web. I found that the left hand side of the AppLib screen had what looks like tabs, but they only occasionally work. The Applib is being updated; I sometimes see new applications, recently including the Dolphin browser (a bit better than the stock one, but not so good as Skyfire).Access to the internet is via WiFi only; no 3G or other capabilities. In some ways this limits the usefulness as a purchase, but it also means there was no need to design in any compromises found in a more mobile device. There is no GPS capability (hopefully you know where you live!).There are some DRAWBACKS to the software:There is no task manager, so I was unable to switch between running applications, unless they were the sort of applications that showed an icon on the top bar (some did, some didn't). The question became how to close those apps. One of the \"AppLib\" programs turned out to be an application that closed other programs. I used it frequently. But overall the device works pretty well.The built-in file manager does not have a way to select multiple files, or any way I could figure out to create folders. One of the downloaded applications did have folder create functionality.The built-in browser will not run flash, and there is no U-tube capability, so many websites would not show video or other content. It is possible to download the SkyFire browser, but one must do a Google search on \"skyfire download to PC\", because almost all websites refer the user to the Android Market to download - which won't work on this device. After that one can click on the download install package. Skyfire does render pages and videos well.I found that many of the .wmv files downloaded from the web would not play on the device, even though they played on my computer. AVI files were fine. It will not play .rm files either. For music, MP3 files were fine.I could not find a way to make the media files go to the mSD card besides manually copying each folder to the card. After that it is possible to refresh the media list and find the files. This is tedious, and there should be a way to default storage to either the internal memory or the external card.The device does not use the latest Android version 2.x, and the CPU is basically adequate, not powerful. I had to wait a few seconds for some applications.There is NO access to the tens of thousands of Android applications in the Android Marketplace, and I was constantly finding web sites that mentioned software that I could not download. This is the biggest problem with the device, in my opinion.The 8 Mb internal storage is laid out such that there is a relatively small partition for the applications. One of my applications was leaving large temporary files in the applications file system, and the device warned me that I was low on memory. The internal memory was over 6 gigabytes - but not available to install programs! Anyway, there will be a hard limit to how many programs can be installed. But with only one \"program\" directory (accessed via a tab interface on the home screen), it would be cumbersome to scroll down to view the programs anyway. The device is designed such that one is expected to create shortcuts on the main desktop to frequently used programs.The email was easy to set up, but only shows about 10 emails at a time before one has to view the next set. I used both IMAP and POP functionality successfully. I didn't seen any capability of Exchange email, but that would not be expected in a home device. The AppLib has an application called K-9 that fixes all the omissions. It supports exchange, but I did not test that.Build quality:The device is pretty heavy for its size, and appears to be solidly constructed. Nevertheless, my unit malfunctioned for a day - it continually brought up the screen to shutdown the device, even though the hardware switch was moving freely and not stuck. I had to use the small reset button on the back to power on the device if I had powered it off. Eventually it stopped doing this, and I was able to use the tablet. So I avoided warranty repair, but now I wonder what else might go wrong. UPDATE: My device kept acting strange, so I finally did a \"hard\" reset to factory conditions. This appears to have fixed the problems.BOTTOM LINE:Is this device worth the cost? Overall I would say yes, if you are looking for this sort of capability at home. I found it quite useful in checking emails and doing basic web browsing. I mostly use the web for shopping, online banking, and news sites, so it fits my needs. I'm not sure I would use it for movies, but for playing music it is nice.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Glimpse of The Future?", "Author": "Jleblan1", "ReviewID": "R3706P46I9L3VD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me begin by saying this a good, but not great product.

I didn't want to spend too much money on a tablet and for the price and size the Archos 7 is perfect. If you are looking for something that will work like the Ipad this is not quite it, having said that everything the table is supposed to do like playing videos, music, pictures, reading books, ect. It does it quite well, and it only took me a few minutes to learn how to use it (even adjusting settings and installing apps) or loading media. I was looking for something that would give me a little more than an e-reader and this is exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately I retuned my Archos because there were several issues that I felt would not get resolved by simply exchanging the unit, because even though I'm not 100% sure from what I've been able to read, these problems may extend to more than one single unit. I really wanted to keep the Archos because I do like it a lot and because there isn't anything else out there to replace it with, I hope they come up with a better version of this tablet because I would buy it again.Pros1. Light weight, and the screen size nice2. Screen is very bright and sharp, very good resolution (but very reflective during the day) some people said they had a problem with the responsiveness I didn't feel like that was an issue3. The pre-installed apps worked very well I was able to watch videos, listen to music, and read books without having to install anything else.4. Battery life is not bad if I had to guess it is about as much as stated on the description5. The browser and AppsLib are pretty fast and the whole thing is easy to connect to a router.Cons1. The screen picks up a lot of glair during the day, not good for reading or watching a video outside during the day.2. This version of Android does not support the Android market, even if you download some apps from a different place they may not work with this unit.3. No flash player support, for what I've read there will probably not be any flash player on this item, unless Archos updates the OS which is not likely.( you can use the Skyfire browser but it is not an ideal replacement for flash.4. One issues with the hardware is that, the unit gets pretty hot relatively quick while using it and very hot while charging it which can become uncomfortable.5. My particular unit crashed with the first video I watched, I had to press the reset button to get it going again6. If you watch HD videos (higher than 720 dip the sound doesn't sync well7. It seems the tablet turns on by itself which kills the battery, and you cannot turn it back on even when plugged in, without pressing the reset button. The only reason I think it turned on by itself is that every time this happed the back of it was hot and I had not used it for several hours.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worth what it cost", "Author": "RJGadgets", "ReviewID": "R11CXI276QWLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, I really like the Archos 7.

That being said, it's not a bad little device for the price.As a newbie to Android, I found the interface and browser a little confusing if not intimidating. But, after working with it for a short time, it's not so bad. And, while with the basic browser the Archos 7 (running Android 1.5) comes with cannot run Flash - which means no video sites like Youtube, a download of the Skyfire browser fixes all of that. Setting up the device to store and remember email accounts is fairly easy as well.Downloading and installing applications is a little more complex than expected. It seems that most application creators for mobile devices aren't very clear on specifications and installing procedures. And, the technical support at Archos, or seeming lack thereof, as well as various user forums, are not very helpful.  So, it takes a lot of experimentation and guesswork right off the bat.The Archos 7's video playback quality is very nice. And, unlike many other portable devices, the large LCD screen is a major crowd pleaser.  And, with the 7 inch screen comes larger versions of web-based content and a virtual keyboard that unlike most mobile devices and smart phones, is actually adequate for typing. The large LCD also allows for great picture viewing and the ability to setup photo slideshows much like you would with a digital picture frame.The touch screen itself is of mediocre quality. In some cases it is too sensitive but for the most part it may take several touches or a heavy push to read the command it is given.And finally, on the multimedia front, what gadget would be complete without a music player? Undoubtedly the best asset of this little machine is its sound quality. It's impeccable! I've personally never found any device better in this regard and feel that I would be hard pressed to do so.Pros Overview:Affordable.Amazing sound quality.Very good photo and video display.Great size overall.Holds a charge for a long time.Some very good bonuses inside the box - 35 free mp3s and outlet adapters for different regions among them.Cons Overview:The base browser and interface leave a lot to be desired.The touch screen is not as reactive as it could be.Long charging time.The support stand it very difficult to pull out for the first time.Technical support is horrid.", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not ready,and rushed to market", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R2HU3CTD33NTZN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The first one I received had a cracked screen.

My first impression was that the build good quality and design. For what you pay for this unit its awesome. The screen is not the best I have seen, but not to bad either. The tablet is not super fast, but it does what its supposed to do ok. If I need speed I will use my laptop. It does not include apps like facebook or twitter from the start, but there is no problem finding the apk files on the internet and installing it on your own. Archos version of the market is tragic. It does not have much good apps and is badly designed. But again, you can find about any apk file on the internet.The biggest disappointment with this tablet is that even if it has 8 gb internal memory. You can only use about 30mb of this for apps. The rest of the 8gb is used for a virtual memory card. I was totally bummed out by this. I know this is a problem on android phones with older version of android. But this thing has 8 gb internal memory. Why could not Archos give us 200 - 300 mb for apps. There would still be much space left.The touch screen is a old technology and is not really responsive. So you must get used to clicking 2 - 3 times before something happens some times.Looks like most of what I write is negative. But for what you pay for this unit I still think its money well spent. If you're going to use this for basic web surfing, reading ebooks, watching videos and playing music, this is a good buy. If you want a tablet to have 300 apps and games installed on it, I would not go for this tablet.

Combine the slow speed with the very unresponsive hit or miss touch screen and you have a recipe for frustration. Page scroll flicks can be misread as selections and other times are just ignored. Touch a tab and maybe it'll go to that tab and maybe it won't.What it does do well is play youtube videos and it does a pretty good job with web surfing if you're not in a hurry. My internet connection is fast enough to take full advantage of 802.11g wireless but surfing is far from snappy. The screen is pretty darn good for its size and excellent for the price of the product, but virtual keyboard input can be a little frustrating. It works but takes a bit of patience.

I get 2 to 3 hours usage from the battery,even with wifi enabled. I was shocked to find out that the tablet lacks Google Market,but the Appslib store and downloadable Slideme market have good enough apps for me. Mind you Appslib needed a good update.I even found a working Youtube app. Although the ads say it has Youtube it doesn't out the box. But on the web you can find a working app of Youtube.Another thing that shocked me is you can not add alot of apps to the device. It only has 24mb of internal RAM for apps sadly in Cupcake. This I hate.I added only my fave apps to the device anyway.And lastly another thing I hate is the device will freeze up from time to time if you use more than one app at a time ,even though it has a 600mhz processor.It is similar to my old Nokia 770 Internet Tablet I had. It had a 400mhz processor and 128 of RAM and 2 gigs of storage. The Archos has 8 gigs of space and 256mb of RAM.So it is faster.My other ePad has a 600mhz Via processor and 256 of RAM. About the same.The battery has died on my ePad though and I have to use it plugged into the power.Touch screen on the tablet is not too bad,but you have to force it at times.

It's mostly not that difficult to set it up, go online, that sort of thing, thanks to the very helpful instruction booklet anyway. However, as many have said, its best use is for watching videos. Trouble is, your videos have to be the right format. That means you may have to convert some of them by getting a video conversion program. As it turns out, there aren't many videos I am able to convert, either. It would be awesome if you could watch all the DVDs you buy on your Archos, but they are fixed so that you cannot convert them. Some people know how or have the equipment to be able to get around this, but not myself. All I can use the Archos for is watching material I once downloaded from file sharing programs. I guess you could transfer most bootleg DVDs too. Folks talk about watching YouTube on their Archos. That would be very pleasing to me, but the Archos 7 doesn't come ready to do this and you have to find a way to get around that too. I still haven't figured it out. So, basically, I'm very limited to what I can do with my Archos. I can look at pictures and a very small selection of videos that I converted and transferred to the Archos by my computer. It's neat, but it could be a lot neater. Being able to watch YouTube at least would make me very happy. At least I can check my e-mail and surf the net for text stuff. Anyway, the package is great if you are tech savvy and can work around those problems. It comes with a recharger and USB chord, and also a set of ear buds. Over all, it's cool, but I wouldn't be too happy if I had paid the full price for it since I haven't gotten around the YouTube problem yet.

After extensive testing by my two teenagers and I, the best uses for it are as a movie viewer and a primitive game machine (focus on primitive like \"connect the dots\").Pros:Nice screen size for personal viewing of pre-loaded movies. (NOT over the net since the link is too slow and there is no flash)Accepts SDHC flash cards so it is straightforward to load aforementioned movies from your PC or Mac.The screen does look good (but not super)It has an integral \"kick stand\" to prop it up on a table in landscape modeThere is an apps web site and many of the apps are free. (Con: you wouldn't want to pay for most of them anyways)Included email and browser functions nomincally work, but ... (See below)Cons:The touch screen is a bit insensitive - barely tolerable. It can, and periodically needs to be, calibrated.The user interface is occasionally frustrating. Even after customizing it, there are items that don't end up being intuitively accessible.The wi-fi is slow. It feels like 802.11b. I don't know if the issue is the link itself or the processor, but it's faster to browse the net on my Blackberry Tour.The processor never feels snappy. For instance, photos display acceptably fast, but just barely. If you use this as a photo viewer, make sure you trim the photos to the Archos screen size because you don't want to wait for this baby to re-scale he photos as you view them. It will be just too slow.The power charger plug is not well attached and falls out a little too easily. It falls out easily enough that this is NOT just a safety issue to keep it from being dragged off the table, it's too loose.The Archos does not play flash, and it doesn't do Quicktime, and it has other format limitations for sound, movies and photos. If you are not a bit computer handy, you are going to be pretty limited. If you are handy, you are going to end up doing a fair number of format conversions.Does not support Mac. You have to transfer files using an SDHC reader/write or use the whole unit as a mass storage device connected to the Mac's USB port.The included headphones are of poor quality and should have been excluded and traded off for a motion sensor or camera capability or something we care about.The browser is vestigial. I ended up downloading Opera Mini v5 beta to replace the included one. Opera's caching system for mobile devices makes the Archos seem acceptably fast for many popular pages. Of course, if it's not a cached page, it's back to slow, slow, slow again ... The included browser is so bad, I would only use it once to help download Opera MiniThe email application works, and is just better than nothing. If you get five emails a day, it would be fine. If you get a 100 emails a day, this is just not going to work for you. One example: you can only select or delete ONE email at a time.BEST FOR LAST!! THIS THING CRASHES A LOT! It crashes enough that you will not want to rely on it for typing long emails, etc. Like I said earlier, not a bad photo and movie viewer, as long as you convert them to one of the formats this supports.SummaryThe Archos sells for about $200.

The touch screen, when it worked, was very usable.Sync with Windows 7 and Media Player 10 worked without an issue.MiroSD slot worked as \"expandable\" memory for the unit.Worked well as an E-book reader with the included app.Battery life seemed reasonable but drained quickly when watching video.Cons:I encountered many times where the touch screen would just stop responding and the areas around the edges cause the unit to do undesired commands. The touch screen does not support multi-touch.Lacks an accelerometer so it only works in fixed orientations.The Wifi required SSID Broadcasting to be enabled to connect to any network, even when hard coding the network info, and the reception was absolutely terrible even when 2 feet away from  my router. It would drop connections frequently or just not connect at all. The network \"scan\" feature failed to pickup any network in the area... I know from other wireless devices there are at least 3 networks within easy range. This is the only wireless device I've had trouble with reception on my networks. I have 2 Xbox 360's using wifi, LG wireless Blu-ray, wireless printer and laptops that all connect perfectly with outstanding wifi reception quality.The web surfing experience is more like a cell phone then the true web since it connects to most websites mobile offerings over the true website. There was no flash support on the unit, so forget about most every video offering on the web. I've read there is an add on available from Archos at an additional cost that allows this but it wasn't worth the extra money for this unit since I had so many other issues with it. Some sites, like Revision3, would stream video but the quality was horrible and basically unwatchable.Video playback from the local unit transferred by Media Player sync or just with file transfers with supported formats, ie MP4, to either the internal memory or the SD Card was full of artifacts and issues in both WMV and MP4 formats.Apps and the unit crashed often.Updates for the apps did not work correctly and would crash the unit.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Archos 7 Home Tablet", "Author": "poper117", "ReviewID": "R2VNJJZ8W0Q3AK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All I really wanted was a MP3 player.

It has USB host, a MicroSD slot, Wi-Fi, a kickstand, a 7\" screen, long battery life and a whole host of Android applications.[...] ([...]).In reality, the Archos 7 is just a very basic Android tablet - very little effort was put into making the software experience anything to write home about. The Archos media player is probably the only good part, because it works well, indexes media nicely, and adds support for file formats not normally supported in Android.Sadly, that is where the \"good\" ends - the screen is dreadful, the touch portion is a hassle, the kickstand is a weak piece of plastic, and the USB host feature requires an additional cable.Performance is sluggish, the Archoslib market is a very poor replacement for the Google Android market (which you can't load onto it) and the selection of available apps is poor. Yes - you can load your own apps onto the device, but why put more effort into this?I do think Archos deserves praise for the Archos 7 - and I think Android has a future on tablets, just not products from Archos. They have a poor history of product support, and they tend to abandon products very quickly (just ask anyone with an Archos 9).The worst part of the Archos 7 is the Android 1.5 operating system - seriously, you are over a year behind the trend with this, and lose out on a bunch of features. And sadly, knowing Archos, you'll never see this thing move on to anything beyond 1.6.All in all - you really do get what you pay for.

Unfortunately this is also it's down side. With this ability many manufacturers put out cheap crappy hardware and hope people with buy it up and make a quick profit.

The store model would not turn on.  The sales rep told me they had some trouble with the sample model due to \"in store abuse\" and he was calling tech support.  I went to a different Best Buy and that store's sample worked.  It seemed to be a decent option for the money.  I should have taken that as a warning...Well, I received it yesterday on Christmas day.  I charged the battery and used it for 2.5 hours.  Then, the options for shut down just appeared... I repeatedly hit \"cancel\" and it continued to pop up...  I then finally said \"shut down\" and that is the last time it turned on.  So, after 2.5 hours of simple use (I didn't even download any apps...), I had a $200 paper weight.I promptly returned it to my local Best Buy this morning... and by the looks of the other reviews, I am not the only one.I have learned, Tablets are indeed \"You Get What You Pay For\".

If you are interested try appslib.com and slideme.org to view applications available before you buy.The Archos 7 is light, quite sizable and serves my needs for surfing net late at night without having to boot up my laptop.  Its also great for checking email although typing is quite cumbersome on the android keyboard.The apps make it handy, I like to check the weather, check whats on at the movies and stuff like that.It can also play video and music and display photos.  All these functions I use on a fairly regular basis.So for my needs its perfect: surfing the net, checking mail, listening to music, showing off pics of the family and using a handful of favorite applications.What makes it really neat and the main reason i bought was to read ebooks which I borrow from my public library and read.  The are in ePub format and are DRM protected.  I looked through appslib and slideme and found several ebook readers and ebook downloads (including wheel of time my fav); however, there was no kindle, no adobe digital editions, and no nook.  So I was stumped, until I went to the overdrive media console website which is the software my library recommended.  I used my ARchos 7 internet to browse to the site, clicked on the android download for overdrive media console for ebooks, and installed the application.  It installed perfectly, I opened it browsed to my library [...] and downloaded the 3 ebooks from my account. Books installed fine.  Overdrive does audio books too, which my library also offers.The only other negative thing about the Archos 7 is the learning curve using the screen, initially i would keep clicking on something when I was trying to drag the touch screen.  It was a little frustrating, but it got easier and now its hardly a problem at all.

They really limited you to only a few small things to enjoy, including a small amount of APS.It will not become a toy for our 3 year old, as he has fallen in love with his sister's Ipod touch.  but again we have hit a snag as it seems to say we have to space left but we have virtually nothing on the device-  It is CRAP.....*******I am a not very techie person, my hubby is a techie type.We also do not own any smartphonesDay one thoughts...Out of the box, it looks realy nice and was A comfortable size to hold.It started up and ran quickly.It was easy to navigate around the apps screen, and was easy to connect the Wi-Fi.Once I started playing around though I seemed to hit walls of limits right away.The \"radio\" that comes with it, deezer is useless IMO.I found once I started trying to go to websites I would freuently get errors.DOing a little research I discvered Downloading Skyfire to the device seemed to be a key to getting past these limits.I found out to DL the APK version to your computer first and then drag it into your Archos file while it is connected to the computer.Install it and VOILA the web is now open and ready to use. (my first day and I was enjoying the Vevo website featured on Skyfire).Skyfire lets you view websites in desktop OR mobile format.Hubby pointed out that too bad they did not make this a 3G item like my Kindle is.  That way you can surf the internet from anywhere not just YOUR Wi-FI spot, or trying to find hotspots.Before DL skyfire he was realy disappointed with the tablet as a truely mobile internet device.  It would only be good for DL your own music videos, ebooks, or apps, I was OK with it being good for that, but skyfire really gave it that extra enjoyment.I think it is worth the time to find help sites for the Archos 7 to help you get as much as you can out of this little device.I do find surfing the internet a little frustrating as what you would think is a \"home\" button on the top left brings you back to the multimeda page not an internet home page.This is also where the \"cranky\" touch screen can be a bit ummmmm irratating.Yes the touchscreen can be a bit \"cranky\", my first touchscreen device so I am still happy.My next goal is to figure out how to get some movies or shows on here for my 3 year old to watch while we are out and about..

The 8GB of internal memory was under 7 GB after the operating system grabbed what it needed.  That was fine with me because I intended to store my videos and music on a 16GB microSD card. Big mistake.I'm familiar with Android, but try as I might I couldn't get the thing to recognize any file on the microSD card. First I mounted the card directly on my computer and copied some videos over. The Archos didn't even see them and just said the card was empty. I then tried hooking the Archos up to my computer with a micro-USB cable and transferred files that way. Same result. I placed the files into a folder on the card.  The Archos showed me the folder but said there was nothing inside. Nothing I did could make it see any file on the card not even installing them via the sdcard folder in internal memory.Then there was the touch screen.  I knew beforehand it was a resistive screen, not capacitive, and that was fine with me.  What was NOT fine was the unresponsiveness of the screen.  I had to calibrate it multiple times before I got it to work, but even then the top and bottom edges refused to respond properly.  I had to take a stylus and shove it up hard against the top edge of the bezel to get the screen to respond.Finally there's the matter of Archos tech support, which is a joke.  I could could never get through to a human being in spite of their being open 24/7 (really?). Even at 2 AM all I got was the infamous \"We are experiencing an unexpectedly high volume of calls.

Lack of volume rocker. Thats done by software only, ugly icons on the top of the screen. No real buttons. The menu, back, search, and home are also touchscreen only. If the particular app you are using doesnt display them you will be locked into it forever.Widescreen only. No accelerometer to tell it you switched orientation. And no software control to tell it to go portrait.The lock/power on button is solid. It has an easy access microSD slot, which is good if you plan on playing movies.The thing is heavy, even for its size. Should be more high grade plastic and less metal. Metal is fine on my Droid because the whole device is so small. On the Archos its a pain.Turned it on and asked for a calibration but the touch screen is junk anyway. Calibrating frequently fails and even after doing it, the screen often misreads my taps. Resistive and not terribly accurate. Typing on the virtual keyboard is a nightmare. No way I'd use thing thing for regular email.No gmail app, just the regular email app and all accounts must be set up manually. Reader looks meh. Can see attachments but cant download them. Thing is too big to comfortably use the virtual keyboard either one handed or two handed. And since theres no way to get 3rd party apps I will be stuck with their crummy keyboard.Screen is horrid. Only 480x800 which is worse than my Droid. Poor color as well looks like low quality 16 or 18 bit. Default wallpapers are OK and you better like them cuz it doesnt seem to want to allow downloaded jpg's as wallpapers. The stupid photo frame and photo viewer apps work poorly. Touch screen hangs up a lot, rarely registers my clicks. Many apps hiccup when they load so I cant tell if the thing is frozen or if it just didnt know I wanted it to do something.Web browser is painful and slow, I dont think it is getting max use out of my wifi and the page renderer is garbage. My Droid is much faster. Over wifi, pages that take 10 seconds to load on my Droid take almost a minute on the Archos. Can download pics but its clunky. Wallbase.net is way too heavy for it, frequently freezes. But I got a couple nice widescreen pics. Now I just have to figure out how to make the image viewer use them as wallpapers. I may need to go back to the home screen to do it.Youtubes web page does not work for vids, but thankfully I can see plenty of ads.No app for Youtube in the Archos App Library either. Archos claims this thing supports 802.11 b/g/n but stuff loads too slowly for it to be any faster than b.I can download mpg's and WMV's and WMA's and more, but the player cant run any of them. They advertise this unit specifically as a media player. Do they expect me to convert everything I own to the two formats they do support? That micro Zune player I tried out last month had better file support than this thing.The apps page is limited to some basic multimedia stuff and rotten games and a really rotten newspaper program. No Market so I dont know why they gave me that warning at boot up about how my experience may be different with 3rd party apps.Playing around in the settings menu I noticed there isnt nearly as much as on a real Android device. No password that I can find. No way to see which version of Android I have, though looking at the stupid Tab it has to be 1.5 or 1.6. No way to check for system updates so I guess Archos planned for this thing to stay as it is without any support.Not impressive. I'd rather have a superior smartphone than an inferior tablet. There is nothing good about this device except for the large screen and since it has fewer colors and lower resolution, its not a benefit but a liabiltiy. The lower res and poor color on a bigger screen is so much more obvious. Cant do much for multimedia so its no good to take on car trips. Cant play any vids or stream them so its not an entertainment system at all, (despite the claims on their website)If it were faster, more stable, and easier to use it would be a decent news/weather/email device but those functions are poorly implemented as well. If it weighed less I'd be inclined to take it around to show people how crummy it is, but I dont even feel like doing that. If it were much smaller like my phone it would be OK for taking to the gym, since music apparently does work.Games arent fun because its not good for two handed use or easy for one handed. They put the speaker right where your hands normally hold it so you cant hear much anyway. Moving images look horrible in games. The few video that do play look rotten and stutter constantly.Recommend everyone avoid. It was a nice experiment because it was on sale. But theres not much here even as a novelty. If anyone ever gets a tablet make sure it comes with Honeycomb 3.0 and full support of the regular android Market. Or Android 2.3 at a minimum. Also, hardware buttons are nice too. And the ability to shift between landscape and portrait. I did eventually install a custom firmware to unlock the official Market, but given not much works on Android 1.5 that wasnt a huge improvement.

It runs an older version of the Android OS (1.5) as having an older touch screen technology which you will hate.  My thinking was, I would be willing to put up with this for a cheap platform on which to run Android apps but the deal breaker is this-- *NO* access to the Android Marketplace.They do provide their own app store but it is awful.  Many apps appear to be in foreign (Asian) languages.  To add insult to injury, the applications that come with the device are horrible and without access to the marketplace-- you can't find alternatives.I thought... It sucks as a ebook reader, music player, video player, internet browser, and can't download applications... Maybe it would make a good living room clock!

Overall, I am very happy with its improvements over the Archos 5 IT. I have also changed the rating to a 5 stars after updating the OS to Android 2.2 with the Adobe Flash 10 player installed. This gadget rocks !12/21/10 update- I have been using this gadget on a daily basis since my original post for checking emails and surfing the web for news in the morning while still lying lazy on my bed. So far so good and it has replaced my iPhone for such use as it is lighter and has a wider display for full web-site surfing. The only issue I have is the short battery life which I have to circumvent by disabling the Wifi when not in use.Overall feel and handlingThe unit is extremely light and fits easily in a shirt pocket. It is much more portable than the Archos 5 IT and even the i-Phone. The single-touch resistive screen works quite nice also. I also noticed that the camera has a small clear plaster cover on it which should be removed for better recording.OS and applications12/01/10 Update- Updated OS to Android 2.2 ! This gadget is a lot more stable and works faster after the update. We would need to reinstall the latest Google Marketplace app from the Archos fans site as the previous version does not work with Android 2.2. The Adobe Flash 10 player would also needed to be installed (from the Google Market place) in order to view flash videos from the websites.Archos 5 used to have an application called Thinkfree office installed which allowed us to view PDF, excel, and word document. I am not able to find this same application on the Archos 43. However, this application and the Adobe viewer could be downloaded from the Google Markletplace.  Do some research on the Archosfans website and you would be able to get the instructions on installing the Marketplace app.Video and displayThe display is very nice and sharp. In the demo video, I also showed a side-by-side comparison between an i-Phone and the Archos 43. The display area for the Archos 43 is 32% larger than an iPhone. Whereas the Archos 5 IT has a 65% larger display area over the iPhone with its 4.8\" screen. Even though the display area is not much larger than the iPhone, the viewing experience is notably different. The video camera recording is of average quality. It does OK in well lighted area but the video is pretty grainy under poor lighting conditions. I also found some issues with the Amazon's Kindle viewer. The right side text was chopped off by the menu bar.SoundThe external speaker is much better than the Archos 5 IT and produced much more sound in comparison.WiFi and internet connectionThere are major improvements in the Wifi connection as I experienced no trouble connecting the WiFi to my home wireless network. This was the most annoying problem I had with the Archos 5 IT.BatteriesCharge time is much better than the Archos 5 IT. Took about 2-3 hours for a full charge. It lasts for about 2-3 hours of constant uses. If we leave the Wifi on, it seems to drain the battery charge  rather rapidly. I did another benchmark testing by playing only video with the external speaker at 50% volume. It ran for a good 6-7 hours on a full charge.It uses a standard micro-USB cable for connection to the PC.Overall, I am quite pleased with this gadget particularly its light weight and larger screen size than my iPhone.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Thank you sir, may I have another?", "Author": "Sparrow", "ReviewID": "R3H45JU9KW5KRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's a little pain before the reward, but it's worth it!My Archos 43 was a Christmas gift that my parents chose from my Amazon Wish List. Of course with the supply problems, I didn't actually get it until January 22nd. (It was ordered in November.)I'll be using it to replace my 8 year old and failing Palm Tungsten C PDA.You won't need my decades of engineering and programming background to make your Archos work, but you will have a glitch or two during the updating and software installation process. Just hang in there!Out of the very well packaged box came my Archos, a USB cable, ear buds and the paperwork. My first impression of the unit was the solid construction. It doesn't feel cheap and flimsy like so many products do now days. Turning the unit on, I found the battery at 60% charge. Following the manufacturers instructions, I let the unit charge for several hours to top off the battery.Once charged, the unit took me through a very simple set-up routine that only took a few minutes to complete. My Archos connected right away to my home wireless network, and indeed I can use my Archos 43 everywhere on my hobby farm. I've been over 200 feet from my router and still had very good reception.First things first - Let your unit go out and find the updated firmware and install it. The download took about 5 minutes. After the Archos reboots with Froyo, the real fun starts.After initial setup, select the \"Market\" icon and download the Arctools widget (which is called: com.arctablet.arctools.apk) and install it on your machine. This will give you the official Android marketplace and allow you to download the Adobe Flash 10.1 driver. This was important to me, as my pad will be used to monitor a 24hr ustream channel that I run.Note: I had to do this process twice before Marketplace would work. The first install seemed fine but Marketplace wouldn't launch. Uninstalling and reinstalling Arctools did the trick.Next of course, you'll want to add any other cool software that you fancy. I track satellites, keep ham radio logs  and read Kindle books on my new Archos (to name a few.)I'm not crazy about the audio player interface, however there are many others to choose from in the Marketplace so no worries on that. Sound quality is very good (to my over 50 ears) and video playback is smooth with the audio in sync. I run the very old Windows 2000 operating system, as well as Ubuntu 10.10 and both systems see the Archos 43 just fine. Dragging and dropping audio, video and picture files into the device is a breeze.I've also been able to stream movies and audio directly from my 4tb networked file server. Of course this will eat your batteries pretty quick. Best to just watch video directly from the Archos with wifi turned off.If you're up to it, download the Eclipse compiler and Android software development kit and start writing some of your own apps. It's not that hard and there's nothing like writing your own software.After using my Archos for 24 hours, I can truthfully say that I would, and probably will buy another. My wife and adult son are already asking for one of their own.-----------------------------------Two Month Follow-upI've had my Archos 43 for a couple of months now. I still love it.Battery life is great and I've had almost no trouble with it. Every once in awhile, an app will cause a complete freeze (App's fault, not the Archos) but holding the power button for 10 seconds will force a reboot and all is well again.The Google Marketplace patch works great, though I've found some apps that are marked not compatible with the Archos actually are. I'll get the appp directly from the author and side load it and it'll work just fine.Would I buy another one? YES and I will soon!-----------------------------------3 month updateI bought another one, but the reason stinks. I got fumble-fingered and dropped my Archos. Of course, like buttered toast, it fell screen side down onto a piece of angle iron in my metal shop and destroyed the screen. Needless to say, I went right to Amazon and got another one, as I've become so attached to it I can't live without it!I'll check into having my broken one fixed, as the display itself is fine and it boots up fine. I'll give it to my wife when it's fixed...", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Few tweaks and It's perfect", "Author": "Lucas M. Fix \"Above Average young Adult\"", "ReviewID": "RP8W8YV61WOGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I freaking love this device but to make it really shine there are a few things you should do...At first I was disappointed by the resistive touch screen. It was always giving me incorrect key passes and I couldn't figure out why. I had been using the plastic cover it came with for about two weeks and I finally took it off. I was a bit worried that I would scratch the screen but so far I have had no problems and as an added bonus when I took the screen protector off the screen became much more responsive and accurate with key passes. So... (TAKE THE SCREEN PROTECTOR OFF) If you have never used a capacitive touch screen before it will take some time to get used to it especially people with larger fingers (no offense) also as a note I suggest you recalibrate the screen after you take the protective cover off.Suggestions to improve your android experience:-First get arctools in appslib so you can get access to the android market + If you want to have the most apps to choose from follow these steps (the android market will sometimes not see the device as compatible with certain apps)MARKET FIX:This will get you most missing apps from the market, except some \"protect market apps\" like NYTimes.Setting-->Manage Applications-->All-->Market (Clear Cache then 'Force Stop' -- DO NOT clear data)Setting-->Manage Applications-->All-->Google Services Framework (Clear data then 'Force Stop')REBOOT That is it...-(VERY IMPORTANT)The stock launcher it comes with is rather bloated and slow and it will give you hang time every time the home or app screen loads- Fix this with the LauncherPro App(free)- There are only three home screens (so choose apps and widgets wisely) but you can also customize the sticky buttons which is a plus.-Get rid of any unused apps (many have settings to turn on at certain times which eats battery and CPU speed)-Under settings- Power management- Set to overdrive ...you may not need to do this depending on what you use it for (I play online racing games so I usually keep it on) It really doesn't effect your battery usage that much.Tangent Suggestions:-Download Gtunes Music app and GamBoid Lite app (I just love these apps and they are free... nuff said)-If you are someone who wants to text people but texting bills are to expensive or your parents will not allow it... ie: me ...might I suggest google voice. You do need to have a Gmail account! If you do, then you can set up your own number and text people (over wifi connection) and it's completely FREE!!! (Your number shows up as an actual number on their phone not some email address or server name) if you are really tech savvy you can set up a VOIP and make and receive calls too.-***If you have a wall charger adapter with a Usb slot, maybe from your old Ipod, I used one from my broken Kodak Easyshare camera, feel free to use it to charge your device. You may want to check the label for variable voltage (It may say something like \"switching adapter\" or \"100-240V\") Just use the Usb cord the archos came with to connect to the adapter. Now it only takes a couple hours at most for my archos to charge.-Consider buying a blue tooth gps receiver and pairing it with your archos to turn it into an effective GPSThat is all I can think of at the moment... but I'm sure there is more that I've missed. Feel free to ask questions.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent but with some serious issues.", "Author": "George Bush", "ReviewID": "RRP49O6LWO9SL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For a long time, I was so  excited about getting this device and spent countless hours searching for a place to purchase it as soon as possible. I eventually found it maybe a week before amazon had it available on Simplyelectronics.net. I had read many reviews about the Archos 43 and it looked great for me. When it arrived, i was very pleased. The device comes with a thin plastic film that protected my screen for about week until it fell off.Well first of all the problems, the resistive screen is absolutely awful. I have a lot of problems scrolling and typing is almost completely impossible without a stylus. And it isn't a calibration issue because I have calibrated the screen about 5 times. If this was a phone with this bad of a touch screen, it would be back in the box in a heartbeat. My tiny Samsung mythic has a better touch screen and is more user friendly than this device. I can get better accuracy if i use my fingernail but it isn't perfect and I always fear I am going to scratch the screen.Secondly, the interface is buggy. For example, when trying to scroll through my home screens, the screen will sometimes be empty of all my apps and they won't come back for a few seconds. Similar issues also happen with most other interfaces on the device. Sometimes it will take 4 or 5 seconds an app to even launch from the home screen.Next, the build. The build on this device is one of the things that I really dislike about it. It does feel fairly nice in your hand (Well as nice as a 4.3 inch screen can be). However the back cover really bothers me. If you tap on the back, there is a hollow sound and the metal is extremely thin and scratches easily. Also, the front and back pieces of the case are not secured together completely. There is a gap between them and can be pushed inward a significant amount. I eventually used electrical tape to secure the two pieces together and the tape looks better than the original back cover since it scratches and smudges so easily. The kick stand on the device is a good idea in theory but in actuality, it is very flimsy and seems very easy to snap off. For this reason, I seldom use the kickstand. The camera is positioned in a very awkward position, in the bottom left corner (looking at it from the back side). I understand the reasoning for the , but it is odd to use it like that. It was meant to be used while holding it sideways, and the interface does not change to be used in portrait mode.The music player is actually fairly good. The audio quality is great and it is easy to navigate through songs and is just as easy with videos.The app market on the device out of the box, Appslib is terrible but can easily be replaced by the android market in about 15 minutes.Web browsing was very nice. The browser is very quick and works great. However, no pinch to zoom is disappointing.Another plus is the picture viewer. All of my photos look very good on this high resolution screen. Also, the 3D effect in the gallery (the pre-installed picture viewer) is a very nice touch.I also really like the battery life. Even browsing the web for a long time or watching videos, it will last at least a full day. When you are just listening to music, it will last practically forever. I checked the battery monitor and after hours of music, only 2% of the total battery usage since unplugged was taken by music. It takes more battery to keep the device idle than to play music. But one thing that I don't like is the long charging time. It takes maybe 7 or 8 hours from dead to full charge.Overall, this is a good alternative to an ipod touch especially if you're an apple hater like me.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "IMPRESSIVE ANDROID MP3 PLAYER", "Author": "MERTMAG \"mertmag\"", "ReviewID": "R2W2UH1DB0W6ZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Archos 43 has a very sensitive screen for a resistive screen.

That is where this device is perfect. Also, I played with the Samsung Galaxy Tab at Best Buy before I bought this and I did not like it. It is bulky and really this fits perfectly anywhere and has the same amount of storage and does the same thing for about $400 less!Pros:It does everything an IPhone does except make calls. If you want to pay $100 per month to add the calls be my guest. OR you can get a nice pre-paid T-mobile phone and pay $10 per month. This device has a Wifi built in. I got a MiFi from Verizon. They are running a special. $35.99 per month for 3gigs on their 3 g network. Plus I am ditching my $35 per month internet on the landline because the Mifi will connect up to 5 devices at once. So I actually saved money by getting the Mifi. With the Mifi this device is like having a full computer at your fingertips anywhere you go! Plus it is like lightning! If you need more than the above this device is not for you.If you don't want to shell out the money for the Mifi you can tether. For those who said Tethering does not work THEY ARE WRONG! Tethering absolutely works. You MUST have the cell company's APN to type into the Archos or it will not connect. It will NOT Work with a Blackberry! I have an old Blackberry and it would not work. I also have a Motorola RIZR pre-paid which worked perfectly but I didn't want to have to tether so I got the Mifi. You can Google your cell company's APN because when I called T-Mobile they wouldn't give it to me. So I looked it up and found it on Wikipedia! To tether just go to settings --> Blue tooth. Make BOTH your phone and Archos discoverable in Blue tooth first.Then when it pops up add the APN where indicated. It takes some practice but it DOES WORK. It is just slower than Wifi or Mifi.The video, MP3 player, and photo features are beautiful. It is very easy to add files. Just plug it in to your desktop or laptop and hit \"Mount\" then move the files over. It is that easy. I had to download Cinema to play certain videos but that is no different than other programs. Not all videos play on my desktop either. You Tube videos play fine.My outlook e-mail goes right to my Archos. It was very easy to set up. I got the angry birds app and it's addicting. Just saying!The book reader is Great! There are many classics FREE for you to download and read! It zooms just like the kindle and fits in your pocket or purse! (unlike the Kindle. Sorry Amazon)The battery life is superb! So it takes 7 hours to charge. Just put it in when you go to bed. You're not going to use it while you're sleeping right?I downloaded all my favorite apps from the Android Market (yes apps lib is not great) Weather Channel, Facebook, You Tube, CNN, etc...The living wallpaper is adorable! I love the mirrored lake.It has a clock. It goes to sleep when you're not using it to save the battery or you can leave it on all of the time.The user manual is right in the device.I love the radio app too! You can listen to radio stations from all over the world.Cons:Yes you have to tap sometimes twice to get the apps to load. It's not really that annoying. Again do you want to pay $600 for an IPhone? or Tap your finger twice????Yes the keyboard takes some practice. Use your nail or get a stylus.Mifi is the best choice for using this device on the internet outside of an area where there is free Wifi. I was in the car traveling for hours and my mifi did not falter once! It was great! I signed up for the one year contract so when 4G comes out I can trade up.I haven't seen cases for these yet. But I bought a comparible case to protect it.Yes get screen protectors. The one it comes with will fall off.Keep in mind this device is $200 and change?!!! The Samsung Galaxy without contract is over $600 and you can't put it in your pocket! This is a little bigger than an IPhone. The Dell Streak is $499 The Zoom is $700!I really love this device!

I was incredibly lucky to stumble upon it on amazon. It is fabulous. You don't realize it's true beauty until you actually get to see it in person. The screen is about the size of the whole ipod touch. It is huge! However it is not too big because it easily fits in your pocket. The kickstand is very nice, I ended up using it a lot more than I thought I would. One problem is that it does not come with the google marketplace out of the box, and the app store that comes on it is really bad. However doing a few searches for google market place on Archos 43 will show you how to put it on very easily. Once it is on there are a few slight problems, the calender app doesn't work. Also the icons on the side of the screen (search, home, settings, and back) don't ever go away in non-archos apps. So occasionally this will cut off the bottom of apps but this never causes any major problems. Doodle jump is one app that is a little bit strange. It still works great but the score is cut off on the top and in order to press a button on the home screen you must click below it. However everything else still works. Sometimes the Archos will freeze up for 5 seconds but this is rare. The video playback is spectacular, it plays so many different types of video. Also the screen makes watching videos look so much better. The Music app that comes on it is nice but nothing special. However the speakers are very loud, much louder than my LG Dare. If you are considering an ipod touch because it is easier to sync with iTunes. This is true it is much easier to sync with iTunes but there is an application for your computer called DoubleTwist that can sync iTunes with your android device and it works very well. This device is a lot better than an ipod touch if you are tired of all of the restrictions Apple has put on their products. You can sync the Archos 43 with any computer!

With that said comparing this unit to the IPod Touch there are some downfalls. The touch screen on the Archos is very difficult to scroll and if you have used an IPod Touch before this will be very disappointing. The unit also has a more fragile feel than the IPod Touch. Saying it is not well built is a bit strong but the IPod Touch has more heft and has a more durable feel. I am very satisfied with the Archos 43 and if it holds up well I will continue to support them.After a week of trying to like this product sadly it went back. I could not get over the absolute inability to scroll the screen. I had two other issues as well, during a movie playback the video would flicker and freeze. This happened on all movies tested (played fine in other devices). The second while listening to music you would here a static noise every time a button was pressed on the home screen.

Everywhere(except simple electronics) has been out since mid-November. Archos didn't do all too great with making this widely availible, which is a shame, considering that it is very good at what it does. Now, on to the actual product. The package is a nice, simple package that sort of reminds me of the iPhone 4's packaging. The finish is nice, but the back is a finger print magnet, but that can be easily taken care of with a cloth or a sleeve. The kickstand is a bit far toward one side however, so it makes using it impractical on some surfaces. The screen is nice and big, and despite the fact that it is a resistive touch screen(less sensitive and doesn't support multi-touch), you don't need to use a stylus or your fingernail with it and can get away with using your fingers. The hardware is very speedy. After you install the latest firmware, and set the power management option to overdrive(allows the processor to run at 1 GHz instead of 800 MHz), it gets a score of 1565 on quadrant. For a sense of how high this number is, it is the second highest score out of all android devices on the market to date, with the Nexus S(which runs the next version of android, version 2.3) being the only device to beat it, with a score of 1583. This device, however, is not without it's issues. Google has yet to officially sanction the Google market place on non-phone devices, so in order to get access to most apps for android, you must install a 3rd party hack for the market place to run. Some users may not feel comfortable with installing such a package, and thus should steer clear. Also, the camera is of pretty poor quality, so when you take a picture with it, don't expect the picture to be DSLR quality. Another potential con for this device is that it doesn't have a front facing camera. While this isn't a huge deal, the higher end phones now a days are coming out with it(the HTC Evo 4G, the Samsung Epic, the Nexus S), so I don't really see why Archos decided not to put one in there. When comparing it to the iPod Touch, it really speaks to a different market. If android is where your fancy is, if you like the idea of being able to install 3rd party apps or being able to make your own apps without spending much money, or if you want a high performance mp3 player, than the Archos 43 is probably for you. if you want an experience that is smooth, but more restricted, or if you want a more tried and true pmp, than I suggest you go with the iPod touch.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "The horror of reviews", "Author": "Rlphcrg520", "ReviewID": "R1HA4V7H3LY0YA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Archos 43 about a month ago after reading many reviews. If I had just read all the good reviews I would have purchased it immediately. After reading all the bad reviews they made it more difficult to decide as to buy or not. So I had to determine what I was going to use it for, that made the choice a lot easier. It seemed to me that a lot of the people that wrote reviews wanted to use it to build a space craft and the others wanted it for personal entertainment. I fall into this group. The Archos 43 does almost everything that I would like it to do. I'm not building a rocket ship to explore the moon. If you want it for that then save your money and buy a desktop computer. In fact right out of the box it was easy to use. Yes if fact it froze up a couple of times in the three or four weeks I've had it. It just takes a few seconds to power down and restart it just like your desktop. If this is a big deal to you then fool yourself into thinking you can purchase something that won't have this problem. When you find out what that is please let me know. I really like my Archos 43 and yes I reviewed other tablets.

I'm going to give my Archos a ten star rateing.Update 2/25/2012It's been a couple of weeks since I wrote my review on the Archos 43. Since then I've had a Low on System Space warning which was a easy fix all you have to do is move a few apps from the System storage to the Internal storage or the Card storage if you have a card. That pretty much takes care of the problem and frees up some space and the Low on Space Warning goes away. I've also purchased a Holux M-1000C Sport Gps Receiver and purchased Sygic USA from the Android Market Store. The Archos43 now works perfectly as a GPS. Sygic uses the same maps as the TomTom and works just about the same way as the TomTom does. I have compared the two while driving and they show about the same views. I wanted to update this review so other people who have or are about to purchase the Archos 43 will know that the Gps will work on their Archos 43. The Holux M-1000C had great reviews and works great with Sygic. I wanted to do this update because some peoplle said the GPS wouldn't work and others said it wasn't compatable with the Archos 43. I couldn't find any recent updates on the subject but we have one now.Update 1-6-2013I have now had my Archos 43 for over a year and it is still going strong.

It feels nowhere near as sturdy as any of the other tablets out there. The screen is extremely hard to use unless you use a pen, which is not supplied with the product. It constantly loses its wireless connections so it will report quite often that certain files are damaged or incomplete... when I know for a fact they are in perfect condition as I can view them on multiple other devices. Archos had a good idea here, but they lack the engineering and manufacturing quality of other tablet makers out there. I strongly suggest viewing this tablet in person before ordering, as you will probably change your mind. Also, the battery cannot be removed, so when your tablet gets stuck in a \"force close\" cycle, you have to wait for the battery to die before the tablet is usable again. Archos also lacks customer tech support, so if you e-mail them about a problem, don't expect them to send you a solution. Instead they ask you to send the tablet in for repairs at your own cost. Quite a crafty method to suck as much money out of the customer as possible.

I wanted to stay away from Apple, because of all restrictions that Apple puts on its devices (I don't like i-tunes and I don't want to be forced to use it in order to transfer files). The Archos 43 looked a convenient alternative so I got it two weeks ago.So far, so good. It is very light and very thin, which makes it very portable. Video files are played smoothly, as in my previous 504 model, and almost everything plays. The music library is much easier and faster to use, although, given the storage limitations (16Gb versus the 80Gb of the 504 model), I needed to get a 32Gb memory card to increase it. The sound quality is also great (using the ear phones, I mean).Regarding Android apps, I installed Android Market (very easily) and now I have access to a variety of free apps.The camera works OK in exteriors, and not so OK in interiors (too grainy). The video recording is a bit poor. I didn't buy this unit for the camera though; so it is a fine feature to have if I ever need it, but not a must.The battery life looks great so far. In these two weeks I have recharged the device only three times, and I have used it extensively, mainly for music playing, and often for web browsing (including downloading apps). I still need to test the battery life with video playing; I will have the chance in my next long distance flight.I had read about two issues in the Amazon reviews that almost kept me away from getting this model. The first one was regarding the touch screen, which is supposedly not as good as the one in the i-pod. I have to agree with this; the touch screen feels a little bit more \"tough\", and sometimes it does not respond quickly (that's the reason why I don't give 5 stars to this tablet). However, I must say it is not terrible either; it just required a little practice for me to get used to it.The other issue was regarding the wifi reception, which I read it was poor. I didn't find however any problems. I have the router in one side of the house and I could still get one bar reception (enough for web browsing) in the other end of the house. By reading the instruction manual I learnt that the reception antenna is located just in the lower side of the device, exactly where you hold it (not very wise design, I must admit), so my guess is that your own hand may reduce the reception. The solution to increase the reception is anyhow quite easy: just simply hold the device from the other end (the screen will rotate) and you won't block the reception antenna.In sum, a nice device that works well.

You'll avoid low memory warnings this way. Bear in mind that not all apps can be moved to internal storage--the white tab will be grayed out.Look & FeelThe device's look & feel is anything but cheap. It has a nice back to it, though it smudges easily, and feels nice in your hand. It does not scratch easily and can take a beating--unfortunately, I've accidentally dropped it a couple of times but it didn't faze it at all--the underlying body is made of stainless steel. The buttons on the screen are responsive but some apps, such as 3rd party keyboards, partially hide themselves under the buttons.ScreenI'd have to say the weakest point of the Archos is its resistive screen. I've calibrated it many times but I still end up hitting the wrong key (s), especially when I'm typing fast. However, once you get used to using it, you can avoid a lot of miss-keying. Again, it's a matter of getting used to the way its resistive screen works. With that in mind, it's very bright, has 3 brightness levels, and it supports 16 million colors (FWVGA, High Resolution Touch Screen, TFT LCD 16M Colors)--everything on it displays beautifully.Camera and VideoPlayback of video and viewing pictures is amazing because of the screen's rich resolution. Shooting video on it (it supports 720p) is great. Taking pictures is not so great, they come out dark and sometimes blurry unless you're taking pictures in bright sunlight. It has an HDMI (mini) out so you can watch on a big monitor but you can't watch DRM protected videos.AudioThe audio playback is very good and doesn't sound like a tin can, actually, it's quite loud. The volume control buttons on the side have a nice feel to them.Booting up & Sleep ModeThe only problem I've been having is when I put it to sleep and try to wake it up again, sometimes it won't wake up unless I reboot it--10 second long press on the power button. I discovered that if I put it to sleep with some kind of dynamic app in the background still running, it won't turn back on. So, I disabled the live wallpapers and always exit from any app or game I'm using before putting to sleep. I've been able to reduce my not having to reboot it by about 80%Overall ImpressionI bought this because of the following two reasons: It's NOT an Apple, and the price. I watched Gadgetman's video and I'd recommend you do as well because it gives you a great insight as to what it's like to use it. [...]If you can get over the minor inconveniences of the resistive screen, this gadget is definitely worth the money.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "For old farts only", "Author": "Janet M \"older but wiser\"", "ReviewID": "R3JFHC9DDKA1AT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, if you're young enough to understand the concept of this \"internet tablet\" just skip this review.  I want to speak to us older people who have never wanted anything more than a laptop.  I started buying multi-media players for one reason.  I have chronic pain and \"diversions\" help me cope.  For about six months I did well with the little Coby 1.4 inch MP3 player with radio.  I downloaded some of my home movies, music and pictures to it.  It worked fine but after a while it got pretty boring.  I use it mostly at night to lull me to sleep.  So I researched for over a month, looking for something that didn't link me to iTunes - something I could drag and drop files to and keep it simple.  Oh, and long battery life.  My niece showed me her iTouch and I loved the concept but not the brand.  So anyway, I took a chance on this Archos 43, thinking I would use it as basically an MP3 and video player.  I unboxed it yesterday and honestly within 10 minutes I had it registered, hooked up to my WiFi AND downloaded all my music and videos from the Coby (drag and drop) - Then I went to Amazon.com and did a search for \"download Android apps\" - and my mouth is still hanging open.  I honestly didn't know that there IS an app for everything.  So far I've downloaded 1)World of Webcams - I can now lay in bed at night and see daylight somewhere in the world 2)TuneIn Radio Pro (all the music I'll ever want to hear) 3)Sleepy Time - my favorite! I can create my own lullaby sounds and 4) Quell (just because it had good reviews).  So, I didn't have to sell my soul to iTunes - I didn't have to subscribe to a monthly phone service and I can discover this new Android world at my own speed - at no cost (unless I want to buy apps which are usually 99 cents).  So, if you are the least bit interested just buy it, turn it on, register it with Archos, connect to WiFi and go straight to Amazon for all the apps you'll ever need.  You do not have to go to the Android Market or any of those other places that confuse the heck out of me! When I was 8 years old I got my first Barbie doll for Christmas.  That's what this Archo 43 reminds me of - I just cannot put it down! One last thing, Amazon has been so patient with me for the past three months.  I have returned three other multi-media players because they just didn't perform as I wanted them to.  So, thank you Amazon for making me a very happy 58 year old Android addict!", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Archos 43 - so far - VERY good", "Author": "SM", "ReviewID": "R3M3KIZHBDDX7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new and more functional MP3 player.  I also wanted some additional features - like video playback, Wifi web access, etc., but I did not want to be saddled with another cellphone contract & monthly charges.My daughter has an IPod and I liked it a lot - but wasn't totally happy with it being an Apple product.Actually, the biggest reason I didn't want a IPod is that there is no support for removable-memory - no support for Micro-SD memory.  I bought the 16gb Archos 43 - but with the SD memory, memory is theoretically limitless.So far, I am thrilled with it.  It's the perfect size - bigger display than the IPod but not much bigger footprint.  The default software on it is pretty good - but I opted to find a new MP3 player app (trying Winamp's app right now).  However the supplied video-playback software is awesome.  I spent the $14 on their cinema-plug-in - to add more formats including VOB video format.  It is incredible - through the Samba file-sharing, I can access my video-library on my home network and play them back through the device (including just pointing it at the folder containing my DVDs).  Or - I can simply copy video files/folders onto a Micro-SD card and then insert it into the table.I will say that the resistive-screen isn't nearly as nice as the capacitive/multi-touch that other hardware uses.  But on the positive side - it is incredibly easy to use with a stylus (I took the one off my old Palm Pilot) - and actually, with my bigger fingers, it's easier and more accurate.I have an HDMI cable on order to test the display-to-HDTV option - but I have no doubt it will work.So far, it's an awesome buy for $200....

Occasionally, there will be times when you want to throw it against the wall and run into the expectant arms of an iPod Touch.As you first unbox the 43 it comes with it's own sad little app store called appLib. The first thing you need to do is go to the Archos Fans forum and put gapps4Archos on there, so that you get the Android Mail, Calendar, Voice, Latitude, and all the other necessary goodies (like the Android AppStore). After that, pretty much everything is hunky-dory.Except, the resistive touch screen is something that everyone of today has forgotten about (even though before the iPhone ALL touch screens were resistive), and the one thing that becomes immediately apparent is that the only way to use the screen is by tapping on it with a fingernail. Second gripe, the Android keyboard is a worthless piece of trash, in all occasions, this is across all Android devices whether it's capacitive phones, or resistive tablets, you can walk into an Apple store and touch type the iPhone/iPod Touch keyboard and 99% of the time you will get exactly what you expect (despite it being a smaller screen!), if you do the same thing on an Android keyboard you will end up with an undecipherable mess. Third, every other update seems to take a step back and then you have to wait months for the Archos developers to write a patch for all the issues that they've just introduced. Fourth, there will be times that you push the power button to wake the 43 up, and it will simply hang on you; the only way to get out of this is to hold the power button for 15 seconds, then push it again and wait several minutes while it boots up, then wait at the lock screen as it rediscovers all the media, then slowly plod through the menus until you get to the included task manager and kill all processes, after that the 43 will be usable again.Despite all that, I love this thing. I defy you to find another Android tablet that fits into a pocket (i.e. ~4\" or less). There, that's why I love this thing. I wanted all the power and apps that comes with an Android phone but without the phone part. All the other manufacturers have latched onto iPad chasing and are coming out with 7\" or 10\" tablets or 4\" phones, and there is no other company producing a 4\" tablet.So, it may not be perfect, but I will love this thing until the day that... someone comes out with another 4\" Android tablet with a capacitive screen.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Handheld Tablet - Shame About the Touchscreen", "Author": "M.

I immediately upgraded to FW v2.3.26 after charging the battery so my experience is based on that version.Overall, I've been very happy with the Archos 43. My main complaint is the touchscreen which is not particularly accurate or responsive. I've found that, with practice, it has become more reliable to use but I can't help think what this tablet would have been like with a good capacitive touchscreen such as that used by the iPod Touch... Otherwise, my only other gripes are that the HDMI mode is tricky to use and Google Marketplace (which admittedly is not officially supported) occasionally blacks the screen and the requires a system reboot.Internet access works as well can be expected on a small, touch driven screen. I downloaded the Opera Mini browser but I honestly prefer the bundled one. Email-wise, I changed to K9-Mail and changed to MortPlayer Music for music playback since it handles folder based browsing better. Aside from that, I experimented with Skype and was able to use it for basic audio calls and made sure I got a hold of Angry Birds for a bit of light distraction. I haven't really made use of the video player yet, aside from playing the bundled Big Buck Bunny, but the YouTube plug-in and general Flash based streaming video has worked very well.So, overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and it proved a great distraction during my recent vacation.

At the time of this review, my device has been updated to run Froyo (Android 2.2) and runs extremely smoothly. The touch is a little off sometimes, especially at boot time and when you're running a lot of background apps. The WiFi works really well for unsecured and WEP connections, but can be kind of slow to connect with WPA2 connections. It works wonderfully as a music-playing device. The battery lasts all day when I listen to music at work, every now and then checking my email, Facebook, and the Market.

I've grown increasingly tired with Apple's despotic control over what I can and can't install on my property. I thought it a good time to make the jump to Android but I don't want to buy a tablet. The Archos 43 seems to be an ideal replacement. It updates to the Android 2.2 o/s easily. With some googling you can find the actual Android Marketplace app and open your 43 up to the whole market. The 43 and Android o/s have a bit of a learning curve. It might take a you a bit to find the write combo of apps that get it working like your touch. I do miss the two finger gestures to zoom in on things but that's about it. But once you get used to doing things a different (though not necessarily worse) way, you begin to appreciate how nice it is to just snap in an SD card, drag 'n' drop files without having to pass it through the software version of a Civet cat alimentary canal (itunes), you'll quickly forget a few of the touch's nicer interface elements.A few cons:Battery life seems a bit under powered. But its really easy to turn off the wifi and turn off the screen.The power button is in a really gruesome place.None of the default media players have bookmarking/remember position. But you can get third party media players that do that.The camera/video camera is a bit lame but it's nice to have it and you don't need Steve Jobs to pretend like adding a video camera to an mp3 player is some remarkable innovation.The micros SD slot you need to apply some sharp force to get the card properly seated.Update July 18, 2011The headphone jack is getting loose on this device too.

My previous player is a Cowon D2. The reason I got the Archos tablet is so I can have a \"smart music player\". This allows me to do lots of things; I listen to a lot of electronic music and these files are much smaller than traditional music files. I can pack them into zip files and this tablet will play them with a third-party app installed. On the D2, I had to convert things to ogg files, which were huge in comparison.  This Archos tablet also functions as a USB hard drive, so you can just plug it in and copy files to it. You DO NOT need to install any third party software to load music on this thing. This is another huge plus, because you can use it on any operating system you want.Battery life is acceptable enough. It doesn't last as long as the D2 does though. Watching videos online REALLY eats the battery fast (a few hours). Honestly I would prefer a device that is twice as thick, where the back is just solid battery and it gives tripple the battery life.I was surprised at the sound quality of this Archos, its pretty good. It can produce good bass/trebble with no clipping. However, it cannot match the ear-shattering volume levels that the D2 can.

The Micro SD card slot was very helpful shipping with 8 GB total flash memory, about 5 was able to be used by me, I stuck a 4GB card in it and had plenty of room for my music and a couple of movies.

It handled a 3d rendered game and music just fine; which leads me to believe it could handle about anything one could throw at it with decent fluidity.

The picture on it was very good. If memory is serving correctly, blacks were okay, not stellar by any means, but I've most defiantly better, and worse many that are worse.  The touch screen is not bad; it was fairly sensitive, not any where close to a capacitive screen, like an iPod or a legit smart phone.  I didn't have problems typing or clicking on apps, links and such.  It takes some getting used to, since my phone at the time was also a resistive screen, I was used to it and it didn't bother me much at all.  My dad has an iPhone and when he tried to use the resistive screen phone he couldn't make it work for him, but he doesn't use the cheap phone very much, for obvious reasons.  I have a Coby Kyros right now, only because it was bigger and cheaper, no other merit above the Archos at all, I liked the touch screen on the Coby much more, and the picture screen more on the Archos.  The Archos's screen looks like it made out layers and is not flat all the way across, it is a little waving and can be seen.  Overall though, the screen is not bad at al, just not anything that stands out.The apps...  It doesn't have Market, Google Play, on it and you can't get it legally, and I don't think you can at all anymore, if one can my friend who had a license from Google to make apps and such couldn't figure it out, I know when I bought it I thought it had Market on it, but it does not, know that.  If you get this, find the Amazon app store app, it has a lot more than appslib does, and it can connect to an already existing amazon.com account, which would make life easier for payments.  I liked the music app, I'm just a casual listener though, I was satisfied with the audio on it, but I wasn't looking for problems with it either.Overall while this is a decent device, above both a Coby tab, and a Creative Zen touch 2, there are better android media devices out there.  The Micro SD card isn't anything new, most android devises have them.  The screen is adequate for most needs the picture o it is very clear, same pixelage as at least a 2nd gen iTouch, most probably the 3rd as well.  The accelerometer works, not quite sure how to go beyond that for the accelerometer.  It handled every game I tried on it and multitasked well.  Knowing what I know now I would get it again if there wasn't any thing out there better and I wanted the apps that are there.  As you might have guessed, there are better things out there now, Samsung has Galaxy players now, sizes ranging from 3.6 inch to 5.0 inch.  I don't have one, but they look like a much better, and for the 4.0 a 3.6, a better buy, these have their issues to from what I've read, but the 4.0 seems like a much better deal than this.  I know when I was looking at this I would not have even thought to look into other ones; so look into other devices and find the one that fits you best!", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy Customer", "Author": "Connie Avant", "ReviewID": "R3D4GQTSZCG5X4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Archos 4.3 Internet Tablet is great!

I have always gotten a reply from any emails, their chat forum, (Archos customers only) are great.  Let me give you an idea how well built mine was.  After getting the first snow here in the southern part of IN I made 2 mistakes, one not walking to the truck in a rush, 2 forgetting NOT to put my A43 in my rear pocket.  Okay, after falling square on my backside, A43 taking most of the energy, I dreaded looking at it.  Yes the glass was broken in 8 seperate pieces.  They were even moved around a bit.  Fearing I had lost all my data I finished my work day and went home.  Just for fun I thought, hook it to the laptop and see what happens.  First thing it did was start charging, second it asked if I wanted to 'mount' to the laptop.  Because the glass was broken it took some doing to get it to 'mount'.I could still hear the sound from the button clicks, the camera still worked, my data was still good.  All in all other than the screen was junk the rest of the tablet was still good.  I was so impressed I purchased another just like it.  Just so you know, to replace the screen, $127.00, and that is from Archos.  I am doing firmware update on my replacement as I type this.  Will be adding the Android market asap.

My screen jumps around when my finger is in the middle. You have to push very hard in order to get it to register, often with your fingernail. The calibration does not resolve this as I have calibrated it many times.-Android Market: This device does not natively support the Android Market. It has an alternative version installed called AppsLib. The selection on AppsLib is nowhere near the selection of apps on the Android Market. There is a way to install the Android Market, but it is several extra steps.-Lack of Power: This device has since the start felt slightly sluggish. This has only increased once I loaded it with apps. I often have to wait for my home screen to display (sometimes over a minute), and many apps have lag or simply freeze then close. Also many apps will not work with this device. Google is good to prevent you from downloading them, but it is annoying that I am not allowed to install certain apps because the device lacks the power or a feature.Conclusion: This is an ok device. It allows you to access the internet, and run apps. However after a period of time, and after using better devices it becomes somewhat annoying. I would recommend that customers considering this device look at the Samsung Galaxy 4.0 Android MP3 Player.

It doesn't come with the android market, but that is really easy to fix, so that wasn't a problem. The video and audio quality were great. The touchscreen does the job accurately most of the time, with the exception of the touchscreen qwerty keyboard (although I never really like touchscreen keyboards anyways). The main problem is that, in my case, the button to lock the screen was glitchy. Sometimes when I locked the screen, it would stay locked no matter how patient I was or how many times I tried unlocking it, and the only way to fix it was to perform a hard-shutdown and restart it. Overall, I wish that the product was a bit more sturdy. I owned mine for about 4 months before the headphone jack came loose and I could only get sound in one ear. The biggest reason I'm giving the Archos 43 less than 4 stars is because it seemed like it wasn't durable at all, and also it is impossible (at least for me) to find a place that will do repairs on non-iPods for a reasonable price.

After only a day of use, it might not be really fair to evaluate some things, but after reading some of the other reviews, it is clear that I see some of the same things others have.  I really like this thing, and I am not disappointed that I got it, but, the negative reviews on the touchscreen seem fairly valid.  No doubt I have to learn the different gestures before I can really make a fair review, but I have to say that I agree that it seems one gets better use out of the screen when using a stylus.The Archos applib store is also disappointing.  Case in point... c:geo flat does not work.  I had to get a version that was not archaic from another place.  The app didn't work at all.  In contrast, the Amazon app store installs and works great and everything I've downloaded from there does work.  I did load the Android Market also, so I don't see what the point of others bashing the Archos over it is other than to just whine about issues that are easily dealt with.  Sure, its kind of dumb for Archos to give users a negative experience... no argument there, but there is no way that some of the reviews are fair.  So far I've had only one app from Market not install.  Frankly, I've had the best luck with the Amazon app store.So now that we have the negatives out of the way... I'm not having regrets on getting this device.  While I think there are really neat things about the IPod Touch, I am going to stick with open.  I love that Archos opened the platform to the Angstrom distribution, and that they have no problem with dual-booting to Linux.Time will tell, I guess, but I'm very happy with this purchase despite the issues.  The price point and features make up for the other things in my mind.Edit:I think that the Bluetooth implementation is not really that great.  When the screen shuts off, all bluetooth devices get dropped.  This is not great.  It makes for a very bad experience for a new user.  I had fits with a GPS until I figured out - going through reboots and stuff to re-connect to it.I successfully got a bluetooth keyboard/mouse working, but only after lots of grief.  I ended up having to get a USB bluetooth adapter and hook it up to a PC to figure that out.  You put any old code in the Archos, but then you have to type the code on the keyboard AND press the enter key.  This was not the worst of it.  If you touch the screen after connecting the keyboard, the Archos eventually locks up the touchscreen and the keyboard quits working.  If you wait a really long time the Archos reboots itself, but you can do a hard shutdown too.  Not only that, but unlike the GPS, I can't just pair the keyboard one time and connect when I want to use it.  It will never re-connect later.  I have to unpair/re-pair the keyboard whenever I want to use it.It also seems to misbehave if you loose wifi sometimes.  One time the unit went into a never-ending reboot cycle. I had to hard power the unit down to get that to clear.  I've only had that happen once, but it was not a good thing - but being a computer guy I didn't panic.  I suspect a lot of folk wouldn't take that as lightly.I find the G-sensor screen re-orientation nice, but laggy.  I think that has gotten worse the past few days after having loaded apps and stuff.  Now the screen seems to completely blank out when it is re-orientating.  It stays that way for a while.The unit can be hard to deal with when it cold boots.  It can be really unresponsive due to starting up apps and a video and music scan that take a long time to run.On the stylus issue.  I find that a soft, fat, bubble type stylus works GREAT - one that is designed for capacitive touchscreens.  It's kind of like a finger tip, but smaller.  I still can't use the touchscreen reliably with a real finger, and mine aren't really very big.First attempt to get HDMI out working failed.  I had a cable and a HDMI to DVI adapter.  All I got out of the monitor was four vertical bands of color.  I don't know why.  I guess I'll have to try it on another set up with a real HDMI monitor.  That's disappointing.I do think the case is a bit on the flimsy side.  I tried putting the device on a Clingy window mount.  I had no idea how hard the clingy stuff would grip.  It took an awful lot of pulling and tugging carefully to get it off.  Now the case seems to click a bit when I press certain spots on the screen.I am still happy with the purchase, but recommend buying with eyes wide open.  I'd still get another one - at least until I saw something else in this form factor that was priced like this with the feature set it has (providing it wasn't an apple).---Update on 2012-11-29:  I love the device despite the above.  I am considering buying another one as a backup in case something happened to the one I have.  That's a testament to how much I like the device.  I can't imagine being without it even for a few days.  I wish it had more system memory though.  It has 256MB and when it gets down to under 30MB, it is unbearably slow.  I've pretty much had to prune my apps to a useful set.  I can't keep my essentials on the device and keep games on it.  I don't really care that much because I bought it for the \"little black book\" features, but it is annoying.  I still can keep a few word games on it, and that's okay by me.  I don't need to fritter away my life playing on it, and I certainly don't need to be looking at it all the time when there is so much going on in the people and world around me.  I'm going to leave the 4 because I think the annoyances are just that even though I like the device so much that they do not change my mind about getting another one.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cut my teeth on this", "Author": "JM", "ReviewID": "R2RZ0B9SFLF3QF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...and have been a fan of Archos and the Android family since.

I called both amazon and the manufacturer, and none will help me. Now i am stuck with a broken archos 43 that wasnt even worth buying in the first place.The device cannot handle 90% of the apps on the android market, as it comes across a problem with multi-touch (which it does not have), force closing, lag, or just about any other problem you can think of.The lag does not just happen with the apps, but the home screen as well. When changing the orientation of the device, it takes several seconds, sometimes minutes, for the apps to come back to the home screen. Most of the time i am staring at a blank screen with no apps.The wifi capabilities of this device are next to none. Do not expect to be able to have a connection unless you can physically see and touch the router, or it will be out of range and will constantly disconnect. Not being able to hold an internet connection is by far the worst problem this device has.The camera quality is horrible. Do not believe their claims of \"hd\" video or photo. In fact, the quality is so bad that barcode scanner apps do not work.I loaded about 14gb of music onto an sd card and tried listening to my music, but only 10% of the music shows up on the music app! To listen to the music, you have to go to files, and select each music track individually.Basically, if you need to download apps, connect to the internet, use a camera, listen to music, or have a device that isnt force closing everything, do not get this. If you want to be extremely frustrated and literally throw money down the toilet, then this is the device for you. It does, however, serve as a great paperweight.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "I adore this tablet!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R17HEUY9JCKE6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About the Archos 43 (I have the 16gb version), in one sentence: If it were a woman, I would ask it to marry me. It is the PERFECT synthesis of size and usability. The screen is just big enough to use without a stylus (although I find using one a little easier), and the unit is just the right size to keep with you in your pocket so you're virtually never without it. On top of that is Archos' fabulous generation 8 operating system. In my opinion it is extremely well built.The screen is resistive as opposed to capacitive (such as on the larger A70 and A101 models), and is not quite as sensitive and accurate as its larger siblings, but for a 4.3 inch screen it does the job just fine. Although you don't NEED a stylus, I find that I make a lot less typo's and false 'clicks' if I use one. And since the screen is resistive and not capacitive any old stylus will work, as well as any old adhesive screen protector. Perhaps the only one complaint I have about the A43 is that Archos didn't put a self-stowing stylus in the unit.Great camera for video or stills--unlike the A70 and A101, it's on the back of the unit, where anything other than a webcam should be. The A43 is light as a feather, and holding it for long periods in one hand is no problem. The speakers are as good as one could expect from a 4 inch tablet. There is a MicroSD slot for adding up to 32gb of additional storage. It has a mini HDMI port which I have yet to test, so more about that later. From what I understand, the micro USB port (which, BTW, is the only port for charging the battery) can be used with most any USB storage device, given the right adapter. It does have a stereo headphone port and the output is very good quality.In my opinion, the operating system is a 10 as far as operating systems go. The OS seems almost completely bug-free to me. Every once in a while there is a little lag, but if you keep you apps open they won't have to get cached everytime you open them. Like with Windows, sometimes if you press a button before the last press gets processed the system bogs down for a few moments, but you soon learn not to do that anymore. If it ever does freeze up completely, which it has once or twice within the month that I've owned it, you can press and hold the power button for 10 seconds to reset it (don't worry you don' lose any files like you would on an iPaq). With the latest firmware update (currently Archos version 2.3.26, a version of Android 2.2.1 or Froyo), you can adjust the maximum processor speed from 1ghz to 800mhz to a slower setting which I am guessing is somewhere around 600 or 700 mhz. However, if you're concerned about battery life, don't be. I can go several days of using it off and on before needing to charge it.All in all, the A43 is a terrific little tablet. I also have an A70 with a 250gb HD in it, which I think is fantastic, and if I had to choose a favorite I would pick the A43 hands-down. Nowhere else will you get a better combination of compact size, innovative design, reliability, and usability (not to mention VALUE).

This device is very competitively priced when compared with other devices such as the iPod touch and the Zune.  The coolest thing is how you can set up your email and have it auto-notify you when it comes to your mailbox.Sound quality and compatibility is excellent.  I haven't tried the HDMI output, yet though.  3d games work great with little or no lag.  I have no complaints about wireless reception.  Its pretty good quality.  Also, there's quite a few things that are automatic and are handled for you, but if you wish, you can turn them off in the settings (e.g. automatic typing suggestions).Since the software is open source, there is so much more freedom when it comes to applications and development.  Android market is available, but must be downloaded to the device and then run from the File explorer application.  Just google \"android market archos 43\" and it should appear.Also, for those who wonder about flash, it is compatible but they are working on making it certified.

They have put out updates that have improved performance and responsiveness, but still not official flash support. some people have gone to the Internet and pulled the files down and installed, but Flash is still not officially supported (passed testing). I convert my movies to divix format and play them on the device at 480x320 resolution. They play and look great. I use a 16gb class 10 micro SD card. I run AVG anti-virus on the device, it scans the storage on power up and monitors real time with no noticable performance hit except the time to scan at startup which is about 10 seconds. Get the faster card or this will slow down. when attached to usb the internal storage and external storage map to different drive letters. Windows XP will not recognize the device but works great with Windows 7. transfer speeds are about 14mb throughput. if you write to both drive letters at the same time it slows down. WiFi web surfing is quick and the WiFi connections run smooth. I use Word and excel files on the device and with the last firmware update the scrolling is smoother, it did have some response issues, but now they are gone. I have played videos streaming over th WiFi at home, DVDs, and it plays fine. I did have to purchase the codec to do this from The Archos website. I have installed a few simple games, they work fine, but I do not do very much gaming on it, mostly word files and movies. Firmware updates are easy, just one click under the settings and it goes out and looks for you. Camera quality is OK, it could use a flash. Most of mine auto take as black and white becouse of the lack of light, indoor pictures in closed rooms. outdoor pictures are in color, or if sufficent lighting. black and white pictures are clear. Battery life is good for me, I usually run plugged into usb connector, but I have run for 3 hours on battery watching movies and games, and still had over 70% battery. leaving the device in standby mode overnight eats about 3% of the battery, so if you plug it in during the day you will never have to shutdown, just go into standby mode by hitting the power button.

You may say \"how much could you have really gotten to know your new friend,\" but it doesn't matter.  I'm comparing my user experience specifically to my HTC Hero android phone and my Samsung Galaxy Tab. I've owned an Archos 504 and an Archos 5. This is honestly the worst of the bunch.My first impression was after initial setup. The device told me a firmware update was available. I told it to get it. It failed to do so. Twice. Off to the web to investigate. Archos auto-update apparently never works. I tried to get the firmware from their site and the download just stopped at 39.2MB. I updated manually instead by grabbing from a mirror site.The screen is far more sensitive (in spots) to the touch of your finger than any other archos i've had. This is actually a negative. When trying to scroll through a list, you are absolutely guaranteed that your light swipe will, in fact, select the first item you swipe past. The most effective method is to keep a \"heavy finger\" but it's not an exact science by any means. Maybe you can get used to it, but my other android devices do not suffer this problem.The notification bar... Wow. I love android's notification bar, but this just sucks. Remember the last paragraph & all that hyper-sensitivity? Well, it takes me a minimum of 2, and probably average of 3 swipes to get that stupid drawer to slide open. Calibration of the screen doesn't seem to help.So, you may look past everything I've mentioned so far if it sounds good, right? Well, it sounds good - If it manages to pick up the content you've put on it, that is.I've synced two different playlists multiple times (using windows media player, whose use is described in the manual [...]. The first time, nothing showed up on the device. I navigated using the \"folders\" menu and played the song successfully, so it wasn't \"bad media.\" After playing the song, it showed up in the library. Annoying. Try again. This time, the songs show up, but the playlist itself apparently isn't supported. Try again, still no playlist, but the songs are there. The ID3 tags ARE supported, but the album art on 75% of my albums just doesn't show up. On one song the art wasn't there, then it appeared. I went to the next song and the art wasn't there. Sigh. I've manually updated my media library about 10 times. Some albums, which play just fine if i browse to them, simply refuse to show up in the library.So, the positives. Sound IS AWESOME. Screen is AWESOME. Video playback is smooth, though on selecting a random position in a file, some files take 10 seconds or more to get the audio chugging and resync'ed to the video. Oops, slipped back into a negative.The form factor is superb, but this product is honestly a terrible media player. I will sadly return this. I WANT to like it. I can't.Update:I couldn't get rid of it. I absolutely hate the Apple ecosystem and didn't want to pay an outrageous amount for a phone with Android off-contract.So... how's it been doing? Better, but I couldn't improve the score past 3 stars.1. Some audio bugs have been fixed in firmware updates.2. Problems with album art syncing have been fixed in firmware updates.My biggest gripes are still related to playlists...1. When I sync a playlist (via WMP or MediaMonkey) it NEVER takes the playlist itself, so you have to recreate the playlist. This is less than handy for large playlsits.2. When you play a playlist it ALWAYS plays it in random mode. Perhaps minor to some who listen by album, but I use it for practicing along to and every time having to click that extra time is annoying3. Editing a playlist is horrid. I've seen the device simply refuse to move particular songs anywhere without moving other items, too. Coupled with the poor touch-screen response, and the failure to pull playlists on sync, this is a killer.4. The screen still sucks for finger input. With a stylus, it's pretty good, but thats just rationalization of one poor feature.5.

Its been a great companion on long flights.Angry birds (as good as angry birds can be on a smaller resistive screen).The bad:Battery life.  Unless you shut if off whenever you are not using it the batter will completely drain within a day, even with light use.Portability.  While it is small enough to fit in your jean pocket, the lack of a good case combined with the build quality just make it feel unsafe in a pocket.

If you press the two plates together on certain places they make a slight clicking noise.

As soon as the Tablet came out I returned the reader and got the tablet.1- It is an excellent ereader with many more additions2- Video playing is very good, it accepts AVI as well as other formats3- WIFI a access is very good4- Access to Facebook, twitter, browsing the web, etc.. are a very nice plus for a traditional ebook readerFor me this is a very good product for travelling. It is a great ereader, plus you can watch videos,listen to music  and have access to the web and games.I would not compare the Cruz Tablet to the Ipad. They are different products for different markets. For what I was looking for I am very satisfied and I paid half the price than an IpadA nice feature is that you are NOT tied to Border books, I installed a Kindle reader and now I have access to the Kindle library which is very extensive. You can also shop around to compare prices on ebooks. I could not make the BN reader to work yetRegarding the apps, if you search around a little you can find many apk free, such as google maps ( no gps), games, youtube,email clients, etc. Some of the applications can not be installed since it is based on android 2.0 but I was not expecting the Cruz to be a full tablet since the beginning.For me this is a very good ereader with many PLUS benefits.I would have liked the possibility of upgrading to android 2.1 or 2.2, but the information says it is not possible", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Be prepared to be underwhelmed", "Author": "Robert J. Kierski", "ReviewID": "R336S8WCBXZ5JV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this because I'd done a bunch of research on tablets and saw a lot of hype and anticipation over the release of the Cruz Tablet.  Then I saw Best Buy drop it's price by $50 -- OMG.  So I jumped at it.There are a couple of positives about it:1  It looks nice.  I doesn't look cheap or cheesy like some of the other tablets.  The lines are clean and the controls are where you'd expect them.2  Battery life is awesome.  I pretty much played with mine for 3 days, almost non-stop.  I only had to charge it twice.Other than that, I can't think of much that was good enough to comment on.Now for the negatives:1  CRUZ Market.  It's a joke.  The apps are provided by a freeware site, not affiliated with CRUZ in any way.  About 75% of the \"apps\" are web based apps -- not standalone.  The one app that is available from CRUZ (YouTube) is only available if you go to their support web site and download it onto a desktop computer first.  I attempted to D/L it from within the CRUZ tablet -- it failed.2  MIPS CPU.  Most other Androids use an ARM CPU.  The MIPS CPU in this means several things: a  Hacking it is nearly impossible (You can _never_ get Android Market because it depends on shared libraries that are for an ARM only  b) You will _never_ see an upgrade to Android 2.1, 2.2, or 3.0.  c) that also means you'll never have Flash.  d) can you say \"slow?\"3  Memory size.  The documentation is misleading (to me anyway).  I thought there was an internal 4GB SD card and an external 8GB SD card.  There is only one SD slot and both cards are external.  If you need to swap the cards, you have to quit all the applications that depend on any data on the current card, or you risk corrupting your card.  Not all the applications have a \"quit\" option, so you need to get a 3rd party app the will kill other apps.4  The screen.  There are several things I don't like about the screen.  It's not responsive.  For a capacitive screen, it sure acts like it's resistive.  Even if you're careful and use just your pinky nail, you can frequently select the wrong thing.  It's said to be glass... but I'm guessing it has a polycarbonate laminate so it scratches just like all the others.  And fingerprints... don't even get me started.5  Weight. I'm sure the battery capacity is because it's packed with batteries.  Compared with other tablets with similar battery life, this thing is a load.  It's thick too.  These two make it uncomfortable to hold for any length of time.6  No extras, No accessories.  It has no camera, no GPS.  There's a microphone so you can leave yourself voice messages, but skype doesn't work... so the microphone is pretty worthless.  The speakers are horrible.  Either they're not loud enough to hear, or they're over-driven (distortion).  There is a dock port... but no dock.7  USB.  They say the storage is expandable via USB.  The USB here is one way.  This is a rather lame complaint as there aren't many devices that have dual purpose USB ports.  But I read into this that I could connect my external 2TB USB drive.  You can't.8  File formats/File browser.  There are very few file formats that it understands.  MPEG isn't one of them.  If  you have anything in MPG or MPG2 format, you'll need to transcode it first into something it recognizes.  The file browser isn't any help when trying to load files it doesn't understand.9  SMB/CIFS -- Nope... doesn't have it.  It has NFS, but there isn't any way to configure NFS mount points.  And really... who set's up an NFS share on their desktop or laptop?  It would be nice to be able to remotely share the documents on your desktop/laptop without having to load them on an SD card, or D/L them using a USB cable.10  Video is horrible.  Even though you can get YouTube from the CRUZ support web site, it's not worth having.  Playback in the YouTube app is choppy at best.  Most of the time, I'd see a blank screen and hear the audio.  The app isn't fully functional because you're missing google provider services and extensions.  Playback of local videos are choppy, studderish, sometimes out of audio/video sync.11  Photos. If you wanted to use this as a very expensive E-Photo-Frame... I'd reconsider.  The CPU power necessary to convert a 10MP picture to fit on the screen is more than this CPU has.  Hence, transitions are even worse than it's video playback.All-in-all, I was disappointed.  There are a bunch more things I could have ranted about.  In then end, I regretted spending the $250 this cost.  I was thankful that BestBuy was willing to take it back without charging me a restocking fee... although I was willing to part with the 10% - 15% fee I was expecting to pay.UPDATE (12/20/2010):At the time of writing the above review, when I attempted to access the \"CRUZ Market\" (or freewarelovers.com) from the Cruz Tablet, I found the number of apps to be disturbingly few.  Today, when I access freewarelovers.com from my PC, I see there are many of the apps I was interested in getting.  And... it appears the apps can be D/Led to the PC and side loaded using a USB cable or SD card.  As I no longer have, the Cruz Tablet, I can't verify that these apps will actually load or run.  I also can't determine if these apps are \"browsable\" from the Cruz Tablet.  But... I can see there are about 1500 android apps on freewarelovers.com including kindle, skype, and various other tools I spent my 3 days searching for.UPDATE (3/31/2011):To those who feel the need to post insulting comments based on the information in the above review:The facts presented in the above review were true to the best of my knowledge as of the date the review was written.  Many things have changed in the \"World of Android\" since that time.  While I have kept informed about the \"World of Android\" in general, I have not followed the progress of the CRUZ tablet that I reviewed.  If you have information about changes that might help a prospective customer make a knowledgeable decision about buying a CRUZ tablet, I would invite you to post that information in a reply here, or in your own review.UPDATE (11/7/2011):Based on a response from one of the people who has replied to this review, I have seen the Cruz Tablet at a very reasonable price point -- $69.  I believe the Cruz tablet is worth significantly more than that.  As one person pointed out, at this price, you can buy a bunch and give them to your kids at Christmas.  At the time I purchased the tablet (a year ago), there were a number of issues I had with a it.  Velocy Micro has addressed many of those issues.  In the above review, I indicated that the OS would never be upgraded.  This was based on information directly from VM.  Since then, VM has posted an upgrade to Android 2.2 -- a significant improvement.  While there are tablets out there, and more coming that will have more features, better battery life, and maybe a better price/performance ratio, this tablet is still a pretty good buy.  It is certainly very durable.If on the other hand, you feel the need to post insulting comments....

My tablet came with Android 2.2 installed, NO UPDATED NEEDED!  Furthermore, any apps that did not install off of the Amazon Marketplace were successfully installed manually on the SD card using the instructions in the Cruz guide (online).The touchscreen used to get horrible reviews, but with Android 2.2 on my tablet the touchscreen is almost too sensitive (I hope a screen protector makes it just right).  I use my tablet for large PDF files for school and it has no trouble rendering them (using the Repligo app).  I also use the tablet as a reader; the Kindle app works as it should, no problems there.I haven't tried any real games yet, but it's not a priority for me, since this was just a textbook reader for me anyway.

The capacitive screen is the main problem on my particular device - completely mis-registering any touch on the screen making navigation a random activity. On the occasions when the screen is functioning properly, as it does for short periods for no discernible reason, many of the apps in the official cruz market will not install or run properly on this device.

Showers \"The Empress of E-Shopping\"", "ReviewID": "R5P4ZM0L5Y6DI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the Velocity Cruz T105 and I absolutely LOVE it!! The highest praise that I can give to this tablet is that my 84-YEAR OLD MOTHER asked me to get her one, after she saw me using it!!  The tablet is THAT easy to use--that my totally computer-illiterate mother can use it with ease and she also loves it! I merely \"set it up for her\" by bookmarking favorite websites. Now, all she has to do is get on the Internet, hit the middle button, (which is the mode key) touch the \"bookmarks\" button and tap on her reading choice! She reads newspapers, online magazines and her favorite, Dr. Oz!! LOL!!  She has also learned to use the email function and enjoys how easy that also is. I actually prefer reading my email on this tablet as opposed to my laptop. The print is easier to read, it's clearer and there are no silly pop up ads taking up your screen space!  I often catch mom putting the tablet's music function on softly in the background while she is doing other things around the house--so she uses it as if it were a small radio!! (I have downloaded all her favorite songs from the 40s to today--it holds a ton!) I was able to arrange the music selections into playlists. Now, all that either of us has to do is press \"playlists\" and all the songs associated with that list come up and play! It's that easy!  As an e-reader, this thing ROCKS!! You can change the font, make the letters larger and even choose between a day and a night screen, meaning that you can read this tablet in all kinds of lighting situations--even complete LACK of light! In fact, that is my favorite way to read now--crawl into bed, turn out all the lights, set my Cruz on night mode and read until I fall asleep!  The ebook choices are numerous! The tablet is already set for Borders (saving you the time and effort of downloading the software) and wow--does Borders ever offer you a ton of free books! You can also download many free books right here from Amazon. Some customers have complained about Kindle downloads... well, Kindle is a whole different animal. But remember, any book you could find for downloading to Kindle, you can certainly find for downloading on your Cruz! That means that this tablet is far more versatile than Kindle. Kindle is limited to JUST its own app. Plus, Kindle is all black and white. This tablet has a brilliant COLOR display.  Most tablets in this under $200 price range have resistive touch screens. The Cruz tablets have capacitive screens. Capacitive screens are brighter, crisper, and much easier to navigate than resistive. But be aware, that capacitive screens are glass, compared to resistives which use plastic or plexiglass, so the Cruz tablets do weigh a tad more.  Also, most tablets in this price range have a mere 256 mb of RAM. Cruz tablets have double that--512 mb of RAM--that's a half gig! You will notice the difference when cruising the Web or downloading a book or watching a video!  Speaking of video-watching, I have had no trouble or issues in loading up videos and movies in the AVI format. I downloaded some free conversion software onto my laptop computer. I am a great fan of Joyce Meyer and Joel Osteen. I subscribe to both their video podcasts in iTunes. I am able to download the free video podcasts from iTunes onto my laptop, then use the conversion software to change the video podcasts into AVI. The converted videos load easily onto mother's and my tablets and playback is exceptional! Colors are bright, vivid and seem to \"pop\" and the sound is clear, crisp, and easy to understand.  The photo function of the tablets is also exceptional. Mother LOVES to show off photos of her grandchildren and great-granchildren! My sister in California often sends her little video clips (in AVI format) so mom can see what's going on in California!  Mother's favorite function of all, is the GAMES!! YUP!! My 84-year old mother is now hooked on video games!! LOL! She enjoys solitaire and word-search puzzles! She says it helps her to relax! I am actually amazed (and PLEASED!) at how much she really loves this tablet and how easy it is for her to use! BTW--these games are FREE downloads from the Amazon Apps store--which the Cruz tablet is able to connect to quite easily.  I will recommend that if you buy the Velocity Micro Cruz T103, T104 or T105 tablets, spend the extra $20 for the gel skin for it--the skin obviously protects the tablet, but even more so, it makes the tablet easier to hold, AND, it makes finding the 3 function buttons (HOME, MODE and BACK KEYS) a cinch to find--even in complete darkness! You merely feel them with your finger! This is actually an important feature since these buttons are NOT backlit. For $20, you will save yourself a lot of grief and frustration!! These gel skins are available right here on Amazon and are specifically designed for the Cruz T103 to T105 tablets.  The only reason I gave this tablet 4 stars instead of 5, is it's lack of flash video, a feature that requires Android 2.2 or better. (These tablets are running Android 2) I think that Velocity Micro has now released an update for its T301 tablet so those puppies can now rund Android 2.2 and install flash. I really, really, really hope that they will also create an update for the T103, T104 and T105. As soon as they do, I will not only  install it, but I will come back here and update my review from 4 stars to 5! The lack of flash video is no reason NOT to buy or fully enjoy this tablet, BUT, by having it, your tablet experience can be greatly enhanced, such as watching videos on news sites or even on YouTube.  Overall, for what you pay, this tablet is definitely the way to go! If an 84-year lady who never used a computer in her life can enjoy this tablet, certainly YOU can too!!

I resized a few thousand pictures and put them on the cruz as well my music and movies. All work quite well. I am also making a little wood stand so I can use it on a table and leave my hands free.

This thing dose have  Wi-Fi capability, however you realize quickly how much that 3g/4g connection is worth as soon as you go on the move.The unit is made by a reliable PC manufacturing company, and uses good parts. But with that being said it's still just a little bit slower than I would like it to be. But don't get me wrong it's good, but if you put 800 (+/-) a few apps on it. Then it tends to run a little bit slower.The battery life is awesome when used as an e-reader; however, use it like a movie player, gaming tab, or net browser then expect about the same amount of battery life as an iPod touch.Final Thought: I like it, it's cool, it's new, and it's not junk. And now that I've got the 7\" Tab taste in my mouth I'm looking forward to what the market will bring next.P.S. If your debating between this Tab and a Kindle for use as an E-reader, then there's no need to think about that any more. With this tab in your hands the Kindle only has one appropriate place.....

Pallaver", "ReviewID": "R1SKXKLCRVCZXK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Evaluated this as a gift for xmas 2010.  First time on a tablet.  I am generally a strong PC user and was interested in seeing what value I might get from a tablet.  Evaluated for:BROWSING WEB:  Perhaps there are websites that have or will have custom interfaces for tablets, but I couldn't find them yet.  So hard to browse in a font size 6.  I have big fingers, so a capacitance touch means missing the mark and going somewhere else unwanted 25% of the time.  The double tap to zoom in they suggest helps, but some sort of active touch is really a required feature to make a small screen browser work - and they don't have it.  Also I kept waiting and waiting for updates to show.  This is the same wireless I use that updates in seconds on the laptop but takes anywhere from 20 to 40 seconds on this tablet.FILE ACCESS:I opened the user guide in a pdf form.  Ok.  But I could read/scan an entire page in 6 point font faster than the next page would load.  I really am impressed on how it's so slow.  Seems like file transfers, save open are ok to manage.MOVIES:I tried to access Amazon videos and Hulu, where I get movies.  But they are all flash driven which will never be supported on this device.  I read that 780p will run, barely, if you have the formats supported.  Hulu would not even deal with Android, but showed a message they were working on a solution.  So perhaps in the future?Email:Other than webmail services, can't see anyway to access my standard pop3 account.Microsoft Office:They advertise a viewer with no edit/print/etc functionality.  I suppose a viewer is good now and then.APPs:I'm not a social network person - don't have the time.  So I did not try the installed apps out to see what's up with these interfaces.  Could not access the apps store in ten minutes trying, so gave up.E READER:I did not connect to the Borders APP.  My impression from research is that it works.  I'm not sure how big the library is, but I read that people can eventually connect with Amazon.  I also concur battery life is days - good.  But then they are competing with kindle that goes for weeks.SUMMARY - I think this is an eREADER product with sufficient battery life.  It would double as an inefficient social network and browsing tool.  For most other uses, if you put any value on your time, clearly the CRUZ would be dominated by other leading tablet products.  Eventually I think there will be more easily found mainstream online video solutions to use this to view videos - but not today.

{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Coby Kyros MID 7015", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2Y8GE8ZQ157OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK. From what I could find, as far as reviews go, on the Internet, about this unit, the little available was basically worthless for making any kind of informative opinion as to whether this item would be a good buy.So, after researching what I could of the various Android OS Internet Tablets out there (most with terrible reviews of hardware issues), and considering the purchase price, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase the Coby unit. I was at first leary of buying something of this nature which is made by Coby, a manufacturer of basically cheap, low end electronics.I purchased this unit (K-Mart, $149.95(save $30) in 12/12/10 - 12/19/10 AD - I also bought an additional year replacement contract for under $18 - a good idea on new electronics!), and immediately plugged it in to charge the battery (it notified of full charge after 1-1/2 hours). I decided to play with the unit a little, since I could not resist. I will say, I was impressed with the quality of the unit, it seems very sturdy and well built. It powered up fine and I found it very easy to navigate thru the functions (both on screen and the case side buttons). Of course, I recommend that you visit coby.com and download the manual in PDF format (as I did several days ago).Now, as far as the touch screen, it functions excellent in my opinion. None of the quirks other mention about this unit or other units being sold. And forget about HAVING to use yor fingernail or the stylus to select or scroll. It works great with my finger tip, better than even the stylus. I admit, the finger swipe method to scroll thru lists or menus takes a bit of practice, but that may be only me, because I have never used a touch screen device of this type before. Oh, and the actual look of the screen (800x480 TFT), very nice. Again, better than expected. Enough about that. It just works.Setting up a wireless connection was simple and effortless (using my own home wireless connection). Surfing the Internet was easy too, once you get used to seeing \"mobile device formatted\" versions of web pages. All my favorite web pages loaded quickly (I mean fast) and problem free. (For those interested, even Facebook loads and works fine - I tried it). The Ap for Youtube works great as well. Youtube videos load as fast as my desktop PC and of all the 10 or more that I tried, they played without any delay, chopping or buffering. Way better than I expected.Using the Email AP, I very quickly set up a POP3 account and sent and received messages effortlessly (all verified).File transfers to and from my PC went smooth, using the included USB cable (to the Coby's internal 4GB memory - I have yet to buy a mini SD expansion card).The included Ebook reader works perfectly too.And, the built in accelerometer works nice. The screen will automatically change from portait and landscape mode, with only perhaps a 1 second delay. (The screen self-rotates 360 degrees - upside down, etc).The only thing I can mention, which was not expected, is that when you go to the Apps Library onine for additional Aps, many are listed, and listed as free too. But when you choose them (all that I tried) and download them, the start up screen for the Ap gives mention that you can purchase it or continue with 15 day free trial. To me, that is called \"limited shareware\", not a Free Ap! Perhaps some are indeed free, but I did not bother to search thru the hundreds and hundreds offered, and there is no advance way to know if they ARE indeed free. I am not really an AP person, so none of that really matters to me. The unit does, as it is, what I expected and bought it for, and it does it well.*One note. If you purchase one of these, there is a firmware update on Coby's site, with a Youtube instruction video as well. You WILL need a mini SD card (8Gb or less in size) to install the update file onto first, as the update takes place in the Coby unit itself (from the memory card). (I have not yet done this, but will next week). After this update, the site states that the unit will show even better performance.Battery life is stated to be 7 hours (we will see), with it's rechargeable 3200 mAh battery (a larger capacity than most other brand tablets).That is my experience with this unit. I purchased it for the small, light form factor (no more clunky laptop), the wireless Internet, Email function, Reader and MP3 player, things I use often on the move (outside on lunch break at work, in bed at night or anywhere in the house or workplace, etc), but hate being tied to a power cord or a heavy laptop. So far, it has shown to serve this purpose with flying colors. (Some people have cellphones to do these tasks, but I hate cellphones and believe they are the leading cause of added stupidity in this country).Included is a vice semi-hard protective case, wall charger, ear buds, USB Host cable (for thumb drives, mouse, etc) and a USB transfer cable to connect to a PC or laptop.I realize I have not covered everything pertaining to this unit, but I wanted to post a good and a truly honest review for prospective buyers. I hope it will be of help to someone.I love it and look forward to being productive with it. Merry Christmas to me!", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Keep things in context, this is a $150 tablet, not a $700 iPad", "Author": "Chris R. Field \"christoph281\"", "ReviewID": "R1GKF96OFXGACB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "--------------UPDATE----------------So five months after i bought the Coby 7015, it still goes strong. It has this annoying sleep/wake thing if you dont turn it off that drains the batteries, and occasionally i have to reset it, but once again for the price i can not give it less than 5 stars.However, i recently recieved the Acer A500 tablet (roughly 450 bucks) and i have to say it absolutly kills the Coby tablet in terms of performance in every aspect, the thing is awesome and an absolute joy to use. At 4 times the price that is to be expected, but if you can squeeze out the extra $300 or so, there are some darn good tablets coming out right now that are excellent alternatives to the iPad.------------------------------Review of Coby 7015 Tablet.I got one of these as a 10 year anniversary gift from my company. I probably would have never bought one otherwise. All in all, i think this is an awesome little device for what it is.I see a lot of things repeatedly addressed, other things are not, im going to try to go over every feature on this.Please forgive my terrible spelling. ;)When rating this i am comparing this to my samsung galazxy S droid phone, Ipads, Iphones, and Ipod touches all of which i have used many times.==========OVERALL BUILD QUALITY=========Good! This does not feel like a tiny junky piece of crap like i half expected. While it does not have the build quality of an Ipad, it does not feel like a little childs toy either. the buttons are solid and have a nice snappy responce to them. The Mini USB, HDMI, and DC input all seem like well built sockets, and i have no doubt they will stand the test of time. The back is a hard shell with a small speaker and reset button. It has a decent heft to it that implies stoutness, but it is light enough to carry around all day. All in all, much better than the sub $150 price tag lead you to expect. I dont like the MicroSD, there is no reason for that, they could have easily used standard SDHC cards, plus i have about a dozen SDHC cards lying around, but only one microsd. Keep the micro SD cards in the phones folks.=============SCREEN============== - This is the biggest point of interest to many, and probably glossed over with the least amount of information. As has been mentioned this is a resistive screen. This is NOT the same type of screen as your Ipod, Iphone, Ipad, or Droid phones or Tablets. Those devices use capacitive screens which flat out rock. The resistive screen is not as good, but it is important to know that this screen is NOT Frustrating either! It really works well!  If this is NOT your experience, i suspect a faulty unit.A) Touch and Feel - The wonderful capacitive screens feel like glass. This one feels like plastic, and like plastic it has more drag on your fingertips. The resistive screens seem to have several layers sandwiched together so they are not that flat hard surface, but slightly mushy.  It does not feel as nice as the capacitive screens, it feels like older technology. The slight mushyness actually does give you somewhat of a fingertip-fatigue over time, where the capacitive (droid/iphone/ipad) screens are always a pleasure and do not tire your fingertips. I know that last part sounded rediculous, if you buy this device you will know what i mean.B) Responsiveness - Very good for a resistive screen, in fact, this is the most impressive resistive screen i have ever used. I used to have an old LG Incite phone a few years back, it had a resistive screen and it was an absolute horrible experience to use. I was very pessimistic about this device because of the screen but once i started using it it worked just fine.  It DOES come with a stylus, sometimes you will find that more comfortable, however it does seem to respond just fine to finger swipes and the stylus is absolutly not required.  If on a scale of 1-10 with the LG Incite touchscreen being a 1, and the Ipad screen being a 10, this sits at a solid 8. It just isnt quite there, but like i said, this is the best resistive screen i have ever seen.C) Resolution and Color.  Not bad. The color has a slight bluish tint, almost like an uncalibrated Dell laptop screen. You photos will seem to be lacking some of the poppy reds, yellows, and oranges.  So if you are a photographer like i am, forget using this as a device to showcase your images, stick with your Ipad,Iphone,Droid. I have looked for a color correction App, so far, no dice.  Resolution is 480p, this is DVD quality, for a 7 inch screen this is plenty, however if it is a foot from your face you do see all the little pixels.========= AUDIO ==============its a cheap tiny speaker like the kind found in blackberries, droids, ipods, etc. Nothing special, the sound is weak and tinny like any other speaker of that size, but the quality is not overly objectionable if there are no other options. It is great for podcasts, youtube, etc, but it falls far short of a KRELL HEAT system... as expected. ;)========BATTERY LIFE==========Maybe it is just mine? The battery indicator on my Kyros is all over the map, 98% one second, 32 the next, then 75%, then 63% then 80%. use it as a guide. it apparently has no idea exactly how much juice is left. I suspect it is trying to give you an idea of how much battery life is left depending on the amount of applications running? Even the battery managers on this thing are all over the board. In the end, i can score 5-6 hours of internet surfing. The screen and tablet stay nice and cool. Maybe this is a benefit of the resistive screen, less power consumption? this is just a guess.==========APPSLIB APPS MARKET===========THIS IS THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS DEVICE The apps in thier apps lib market are generally crap, i diddnt find much of anything i was interested in. some of the bigger games like angry birds are there, but there are many others im interested in that dont exist.  There are 165,000+ applications for the android platform, so why the hell should you be limited to about 3,000 in the apps lib? plus they are 3,000 of the crap apps nobody wants. basic stuff like some facebook apps, email apps, are there, but other than that it is mostly junk.But guess what? there is a light at the end of the tunnel!  This device can easily be rooted, once it is rooted you can install some nice software to back it up, and once that is there you can side-load applications. Such as... THE GOOGLE APP MARKET! Yes! This is awesome! All 165,000 apps i want are now available!The problem is you have to root the device (gets superuser permissions) install the backup software (which also enables application installation outside of the apps application itself and to keep a digital backup image of your device, very nice). And to do this you literally have to add a few lines of code(not nearly as scary as it sounds i promise! once of the easiest parts), you have to download several different files all of which seem to require you to sign up to various forum boards and stuff to get.i did this. I am not a hacker by any means, in fact, im an idiot ask anybody, i dont understand most of what i was doing, other than the basic overall idea of what i wanted to accomplish. It took me several hours, mainly because of my ignorance on this kind of stuff. The key is to go one step at a time, if something is not working, search for an answer. There is a website that gives you step by step instructions, there are many posts on there of problems they ran into and solutions around them. Just google up the ULTIMATE KYROS 7015 and look for a website that is like XDA developers or something. it is a online forumboard where people figured out how to do this junk. It is on a forum thread, read through several pages, you will see what i mean, if you run into a problem, somebody else already has, and the answer will be in that thread somewhere.Once this is done, and you have google apps, it absolutly transforms your entire experience with this marvelous dirt cheap tablet because they stuff you WANT is all there for you. I highly highly reccommend doing this (at your own risk) and trust me, if I can do it, anybody can, just take your time, when you get stuck read ahead, somebody else probably had the same problem and figured out how to correct it and explains how.. It does require an MicroSD card though. There IS a Possility you will turn your tablet into a brick. however, from what i have seen, this almost never happens, you almost have to have a flawed device from the get-go, or be overly careless.=========OPERATING SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY=========Not bad at all! Mine keeps waking itself up which is annoying, but it responds to my commands, has only frozen twice, which is more than i can say for most other devices.Keyboard - Not bad at all, works well, you get used to using two thumbs on it, you have to pace yourself and not get ahead of it, you can not type as fast as on a keyboard, but overall it seems pretty reliable. There is no vibration, so no haptic feedback which i enjoy on my samsung galaxy S phone.Pic viewer - As i said, slight bluish cast, it is slow loading up images too. I loaded a bunch of reduced sized images to my droid phone to display my photography to possible clients, i loaded them on the Kyros and it takes about 3-4 seconds for the pictures to really lock in onto full resolution. I was a bit disappointed by this because this thing has a great little processor in it. The Slideshow is about retarded because you can choose between 2-4 seconds on the intervals and the images never really crisp up, they stay the 1/2 resolution blurry versions because they change before the processor locks them in. stupid stupid stupid.ALDIKO e-reader.... if you want an e-reader go get a kindle or nook. that is my opinion. I briefly looked at it, it uses a backit screen, which stinks for extended reading. But the size of the text and font is pretty nice, you wont be squinting to read, and it would probably suffice for an e-reader, but it is nowhere as comfortable to look at as a kindle or nook.The Youtube video app - I dunno, i had a hard time getting this to work properly, then i rooted my Kyros and got the google marketplace installed and it came with a much better youtube app.Email - I am sorry, i did not even try this untill after i rooted my tablet, once the google marketplace was installed as part of the process it synched with my email. it works just fine.Widgets seem to work just fine. I have a Facebook widget, Weather channel widget, Google widget, and a battery widget, it does not seem to slow down with the use of any of them. You ccan use live wallpaper, it seems to run just fine with live wallpaper, i dont notice any lag.Video playback is smooth and crisp, the 480P quality is very much there.Wi-fi performance. The wi-fi on this runs as fast as my Dell Laptop, my Samsung Galaxy S Droid phone, or any other wireless device for that matter. It is not pant-leg-flapping insane fast, but certainly nothing to complain about. If this is NOT your experience, i suspect you have a faulty unit.===============Random things i noticed==============Twice now in 5 days it has crashed while i was typing. Not sure why.it keeps waking itself up. Not sure why. i have heared other reports, this may get fixed in a firmware update later.No volume control on the side, once again, what the hell? You have to set the volume BEFORE starting any videos.Charges VIA power cord..... will NOT charge through USB. I was actually suprised by this, maybe because it looks like a massive cellphone. That would have been nice. Go on google and look up Kyros 7015 tablet charger, and prepare to realize you will only have one. lolmore than once i had to reset the wif-fi in the device if it has been asleep for a while... annoying, but not a huge inconvenience. maybe a firmware upgrade will address this.===========Good Bad Ugly=======================Good -Very responsive resistive touchscreen.Excellent builtSolid performanceExpandable memoryFast capable Wi-FiUnder [...]BadResistive screen. (i just preffer capacitive)Slight bluish castNo volume controls on sideMicroSD card.. really? Micro? Cant just use SD cards which we all have laying around?UglyApplib. This just stinks. it requires rooting and such to get google market apps, and trust me google market apps is absolutly worth the effort, and it is not that difficult, and appslib just flat out sucks.============Conclusion==============I cant believe how much bang for your buck you get. This can be had for well under [...]!!!! a handheld lightweight internet browser that potentioally has access (if rooted) to 165,000+ applications, games, etc.  Anybody who complains that this device does NOT do enough for [...]  seriously needs to get thier heads examined.  Im suprised this is not sold for closer to [...].A few thoughts...To address a few points, one person wrote a review and said the batterys dont last long enough, they popped it open, saw the batteries, then decided to return it. No mention if they actually USED it though. 5-6 hours of internet browsing is not enough? Really? Show me a droid phone that has that kind of battery life on wi-fi, it is right up there with the Ipad. To say that 5-6 hours of battery life is not enough is flat out stupid, because nothing really has much more battery life than this! its reviews like those that i just dont understand. jump to conclusions rather than try it out yourself.Another person mention that it sucks because you have to root the device to get google apps and such. Well. True. Either do it or dont, Coby restricted the potential on this great tablet for some stupid reason that i could care less about, the fact is the option is there, take it or leave it. Those who are willing to do so will have a DRASTICALLY better experience than those who dont. If you dont want to root it and install google apps, then go spend [...] on the Galaxy S tablet (which looks awesome) or the iPad.  To be perfectly honest, i would only give this device a 3 star rating if the option to root was not there.Others complain about the screen, yes, it is not the same as the [...]Ipad. That is why it costs [...] less. Not sure why you would expect to get a ferarri at a honda civic price tag.If price was not considered in the rating at all, i would give this a 7 and the Ipad a 10.if price IS considered in this rating, i give this a 10, and the ipad an 8.Somebody mentioned non-child appropriate content on the apps market, i checked, i did not see any \"porn\" per se, but there ARE plenty of sexy wallpapers and stuff. This may or may not be a concern for you.And then there are some stupid reviews, like the guy chiming in about how the processor, memory, ram, stuff like that are all not known, i disagree, they are clearly listed in every bit of literature, i think he must have been digging through thier grandfathers medicine cabinet again.I see several reviews that give 1-2 star reviews that seem very contradictory to what my experience was. This leads me to believe one of a few things, unrealistic expectations(40%), ignorance on how to use the device(20%), or possible QC issues at COBY(40%). lets be honest, when you think of \"quality\" is COBY the first brand that comes to mind? Keep your reciept and check the return policy, apparently cobys customer service sucks, make sure the store will take it back.That said, for [...] bucks this cant be beat, im floored at how well this works (for $[...]).If you are not willing to root, this is a great internet browser while yer on the couch, but you are missing out, i suggest either root this device or find one that doesent have an idiot in charge of what can and can not be done with it.Thanks and have a nice day!", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be smart, research anything you purchase before setting expectations", "Author": "J. Sanders \"Married father of three,\"", "ReviewID": "R1RHMSZBB52MX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The problem most negative reviewers have here, is what so many others run into before buying something with hopes and expectations. Simply put, you have to do your homework before purchasing anything in order to keep from getting let down by false hopes. I have 3 of these coming in the mail for my kiddo's, and spent about 4 to 5 days researching all of the current Android tablets available in this price range before picking anything. Out of all devices under $200, this Kryos has the best performance, and hardware options available. There are a few that run right up there with it, but still cost $30 or more per unit.I already know what to expect as the positives and negatives of these devices, primarily the resistive screens that are not as nice as our Moto Driod's Etc. But with facts in hand, the tons of functionality they offer, and the extremely low price tag, I was very comfortable purchasing three of these as Christmas gifts for my loved ones.If you have considered an iPad, and are looking at one of these Android tablets as a cheap alternative, then you have already set yourself up for upset. These do not perform the same way. The screens are not the same technology meaning they do not recognize a soft swipe of the screen, or multi touch like most of their mobile phone brethren. They are resistive screens much like the older Windows mobile phones that react to pressure on the screen. A stylus is going to be more precise of course, but not always needed to operate the touch screen.As for browsing, it is only as fast as your wireless connection will allow it to be. Many of the reviews others have made during test drives of the Colby show excellent response times loading web pages. But just like any device including your high performance notebooks, wireless signal strength, internet speeds, and many other factors come into play when you decide to hit a website.I can honestly say, that these are by far the funnest little gadgets you can pick up for this low of a price, that offer so much features and functionality. They will and should never be a comparison to a high dollar iPad with a ton more hardware resources available. But at a third of the price, I am much happier playing my HD movies and MP3's, surfing the web, checking email, etc on an Android then paying the price of an Apple.And I must correct all those out there bashing the lack of Android's mighty marketplace. This is not missing due to not having mobile connectivity, or even funnier, \"an obscure legal loophole\" LOL! This is due to the fact that Google requires high cost licensing from manufactures against their devices to allow access to their Market. The Android Tablet arena is still very new, and has not reached the sales yet needed to take on the cost of this licensing, and still produce a profit worth production. Once these devices are welcomed into the community, and sales become profitable, most manufacturers will have the leverage they need.For most, the offerings of these tablets will provide allot of satisfaction as a media and internet device in your home. For those with little patience, you can't save money and be happy at the same time. Whip out that wallet and go get yourself something more expensive so we don't have to hear your whimpers of an another poorly researched purchase. And for those who are driven heavily on performance, and not scared by technical challenges, get out there and upgrade this Kryos and you will open up tons of limitations and performance from the hardware and OS.Hope this helps some out there.

Ignore other reviews as they are talking about the model 7005.It comes with a protective case, USB cable and USB mini-to female connector. The latter is very useful to mount USB drives. Be warned the tablet mounts it as the 'scsi' drive.The battery life is quite decent (capacity is 3600mAh).It has only 256 MB memory and the available memory is usually vey small. So you need to kill the backgroud apps from time to time.It plays Angry Birds (with some font problems) and other 3D games quite well. Looks like there is a support for 2D and 3D acceleration. However, the Quadrant Benchmark marks around 300. Compare it with Galaxy Tab around 900 and Viewsonic gTablet around 1800.No problem with any book readers. Actually can be a decent book reader considering the size and weight.No Google Market as it has no Phone support. Not a big deal as I was able to install apps/games from various web sites.Wi-fi support is good and Wi-fi stays on without any problems.The is a manufacturer's support web site (cobyusa). It has the latest update zip package and installation video alongside with the online user guide. So you are not alone when it comes to update this tablet.The screen response is OK if you know how to deal with a resistive screen. You should not use your finger , but the tip of your finger nail or the stylus provided.Overall a decent tablet, very compact and light (again this is 7015 not 7005) and performs well within the price range.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Coby Kyros review", "Author": "Carl E Iverson Jr", "ReviewID": "R2HO6EEN9KJWVT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this Coby Kyros Android Tablet for $139.99 at Kmart during the Black Friday Deals that went on. Everything with this tablet works good, I especially love this Pad compared to Apple's iPad which has limited functionality and is priced at several of hundreds of dollars compared to the Android Pads because I only need something like the iPad for the internet, checking email, reading books, and playing movies but was surprised that it can do a whole lot more than just that!This Pad uses Android v2.1 OS, it has AppsLib which is a marketplace for apps to install specifically on Android Pads and not Android Phones. The reason why Android Marketplace is not on this Pad is because it does not have Phone capabilities, the Android Marketplace has apps that are for every feature for the Android OS. Other than that, the AppsLib is for Android devices that would not have phone capabilities, hence, Android Tablets. I assume they weeded through the apps that would work on Android Tablets and just created AppsLib. The HDMI output for the device works great! I bought a 16GB microSD card for this and works good. I played a couple of movies with HDMI out in DVD and 720p Quality to an LCD TV and it looked great, sound was great, and there was no delay, lag, or anything wrong with the video! The Pad seemed to play every video format I have thrown at it. I've also used the USB port on this Pad and it recognized my 4GB PNY, 8GB Kingston, & 16GB Patriot Xport flash for additional storage which is a big plus!The only issues I have had with this Android Pad though is that most games I have played on it so far, the G-Sensors (Accelerometer) are reversed on it. When I play a racing game such as Asphalt or Raging Thunder, you're suppose to twist the Pad to the right or left to turn right or left and it's reversed. This is a big disappointment for me and I hope a fix is released for this. Another problem also is every application I install on this Pad, only about 75% of them will work, and this goes for games and apps.Overall... the Pad satisfies what I basically need it to do so far and everything else is just a plus for me.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very solid tablet, within reason", "Author": "KJ \"KJ\"", "ReviewID": "RE2VVYZ3MJ5QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an IT Director and Developer and have owned or demoed many tablets.

Since the device does not natively support Froyo, Android 2.2., there are several teams of developers (including me) working on Froyo support.  If you are interested in helping, google Android Development Unsupported Devices.  Seeing the amount of interest and all-out effort being put into getting this tablet to support Froyo and 3.0, I firmly believe it will only be a matter of weeks.You can install flash, look for Android 2.1 Flash 10 apk.  The HDMI output is absdolutely stellar...now don't laugh, but Avatar looked pretty damn good coming from the media player on this.I highly recommend at least getting an 8GB micro SDHC card (yes, SDHC).  Some apps don't recognize the actual directory location of the sdcard, instead, some apps are looking in the NAND folder.  Understanding this helps alot (for example Amazon's Kindle for Android software looks for docs in the NAND folder, but not the sdcard folder.)Angry Birds works, but sometimes the words/text are whited-out. I found that if you play \"Seasons\" and let the Halloween intro load, then go back to the main Angry Birds screen, *most* of the text and 3-stars will magically appear...looks like a Rovio developer bug (damn Finlanders! (Olen Suomalainen!)We recently purchased another of these tablets (Coby 7015) for my girlfriend's 11 year old girl (she loves it!)and I did not immediately flash it...guess what, it was still stable and loaded good...I was even able to get flash 10 installed...then I flashed it to the Market release.On CobyUSA's Website you can download a flash update, just follow the instructions in the video and you'll be fine.  I can't post links because Amazon just deletes them anyways.Overall, a great device for what it does, and for the price.  Kids love it, it works well as an ebook reader (Aldiko is not that bad but I like the Kindle App better), you can download NES, SNES, GBA (Gameboy Advanced), and other games to play...I recommend ROMSGrabber...most games play amazingly well though the lack of multi-touch takes the fun out of some games.The USB allows the use of most USB Keyboards and Mice, I threw a Logitech wireless combo and it recognized the mouse and keyboard (the usb keyboard is required for any Terminal Emulator (geek stuff) that I've used so far).  There are folks working on getting USB to Bluetooth and USB Camera support...so hang in there and keep searching the forums for updates and hacks/mods.Oh yeah, it does have a microphone, one with poor quality, but it does have one.  The \"hole\" for the built-in microphone is about 1/4 of an inch to the right of the headphone jack (3.5mm or 1/8 inch headphone jack).  I downloaded a couple of recording and loops tracks, and then learned of the microphone's existence.  However, Google Voice Search does seem to crash from time to time.I fully intend on purchasing yet another Android tablet, though I will hang on to this one for it's size and convenience...and as a development device.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "AMAZING in every way and A GREAT VALUE.", "Author": "Mr Royal", "ReviewID": "R8II3NSS229IF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this (COBY KYROS MID7015) android tablet from another retailer and ended up getting it for $149.97 (A Steal). I mention the model clearly because I have noticed many negative reviews on what I am sure is the previous model Coby Kyros 7005. I say that because the newer 7015 was just relesed on 12/1/10 at the earliest. You will see that many negative reviews were posted saying they had the COBY MID7015 before it was even available. If people want to post a negative review of a product they at the very least, SHOULD KNOW WHAT MODEL THEY ARE REVIEWING. That said, in my opinion this Coby MID7015 is an outstanding product. It does everything it claims it can do, and very well in fact. If you take your time and read the simple instructions it is very easy to set up. Even the internet runs very fast on this tablet, (decent wifi connection required). All other applications that come pre-loaded, and even the ones I have loaded myself, run great as well. The bottom line is this. For a full color e-reader (as good as my Daughters brand new $250.00 Nook color), and an amazing media player that plays everything I have thrown at it with ease, plus an android internet tablet with tons of free applications available, this one is a tough cookie to beat.

After purchasing several tablets before the MID7015 I owned the following: Apple Ipad (8mths), Archos 70 (2 weeks), Coby Kyros MID7005 (2 days), Sprint Samsung Galaxy Tab (29 days).  I returned each of these for various reasons.  The Ipad was too big, the Archos was very buggy, the MID7005 was too under powered - yes I opened the unit to find out why the battery only lasted for ~2hrs. I found it only had a 1250mah battery - smaller than the average cell phone.  I returned it back to the store, in fact a reviewer here may have mistakingly referred to me on his amazon review of MID7015.  I then got the Samsung  Galaxy Tab - loved it but quickly learned it was crippled in multiple ways for US customers.  Returned it during the 30 day return period - I felt ripped off after paying a high cost premium for it and then having to pay the monthly fees on top of it all.  Then I started reading reviews about the Coby Kyros MID7015.  Picked up one from a local Kmart, rooted it and installed the app market.  I am very pleased with this device.  It does everything it is advertised to do and more once rooted.  The price right, the size is right, battery life decent and there is no monthly contract.Let's be clear the MID7015 is not in the same league as the Ipad and Galaxy Tab but it fits my use case just fine.  Email, texting, Evernote, Sugarsync, Web browing, online blogging, online shopping, online banking, social networking, watching a few TV shows, basic gaming, reading books, watching YouTube videos, printing and limited office documents review/creation.I am quite satisfied with my Coby Kyros MID7015.In fact I am writing this review from the MID7015.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "I actually like this item", "Author": "M.

It works pretty good, it reminds me of my Sprint Evo without phone capabilities.  I like the fact that I can download the Kindle app and review all of my books on it.  There is also a great app called Jorte, which is similar to an actual paper planner and I can check my Google mail, when I'm in a wifi accessible area.  Here's why I gave it 3 stars, the issue I have had is the screen has gone out a few times and I've actually had to reset this thing twice. Also, my screen kept fading in and out, only giving a view of colorful lines!  I'm not sure what happened there but it appears to be working fine now.

Lilly", "ReviewID": "R7LNTJA2SG0R5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really people?  What did you expect for $150?  We have people here comparing this to 300-600 dollar devices.  Really?  People who leave a review that is totally false.  It would help if you actually used the device before leaving a bad review.Ok now thats out of the way.  I do not think this device deserves a 5 star rating, I rated as such to offset all the 1 star reviews from people that have no clue what they are talking about.To the person comparing this to an Ipod touch or an Iphone or even an Ipad, guess what, Iphones cost more and require a cell phone contract not to mention having a smaller screen.  Same deal with a Ipod touch smaller screen and around the same price if not more.  Also no removable media, if you want pictures or movies they are on the internal memory only whereas with this device you can use removable Micro SD(up to 16GB)  We wont even discuss the Ipad becuase its 4 times the price.  Show me a 7\" tablet in this price range right now.To the person that says they cant multi task because of the back button, tilt your device forward slightly, look on top.  You will see 2 buttons, one says menu, one says home.  Open an app, run it, now press the home button.  Wow see what I did there, input from someone that actually took the time to use the device before posting a negative review.Ok on to the review.  First off, know what you are buying before you purchase it.  This not capacative touch it is resistive.  These are the types of screen that were used on older devices, PDA's etc.  The newer devices like the droid phones, Ipad etc use capacative touch.  Now with that being said, this is probably one of the nicest resisitive touch screens I have used.  Rarely do I need a stylus, and it works well just using my finger tips.  There are a few times when I will mistakenly click comething I did not intend to but it is much better than I expected and works pretty well.You will not get the full Android market with this device.  Google has already stated that no tablets will be given full market access until Android v 3.0 is released which will be optimized for tablets.  This device is also not capable of being updated to 3.0, so what you see is pretty much what you are going to get as far as the OS is concerned.  If you want the full market on this device it requires some tweaking, information on this can be found by searching the web, and some shred of technical knowledge will be required.The buttons on this device are similar to the ones found on a standard android phone.  All the buttons are present with the exception of the search button.  On top of the device you will find the menu and home buttons on a rocker switch and the back button is the large gold circle that is visible on the front of the device.I read one review that stated the device locked up all the time.  As far as lockups are concerned, they were few and far between for me.  I think I used the reset button one time when I got stuck in an application.  Most of the apps provided and downloaded worked pretty well.I had no issues connecting to and surfing the web and the speed, while not as fast as my laptop, was sufficient enough for me for web browsing.  Not what I would consider to be slow as some have said.With all that being said, I will revert back to my original statement.  Research and know what you are buying before you buy it.  If you are looking for a 150 dollar Ipad or Galaxy tablet, you will be sorely disappointed.  This device works well for playing some games, reading some books and watching some movies as well as surfing the web.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Which Third of Reviewers do you fall in?", "Author": "Edward M. Levinson", "ReviewID": "R2HU41O192SZ2Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you read all of the reviews on this device as I have, you may conclude, as I did, that reviewers fall into one of three categories. Which category do you fall in?The first set of reviewers have very low expectations (or no expectations) for a $150 device such as this, and are pleasantly surprised - some even thrilled - with this device when they test it. Many expected to return it, but find that it is quite the bang for the buck. They rate it 4 or 5 stars, keep it, and sometimes even buy more for family or coworkers.The second set of reviewers are the bargain hunters, expecting to get a device that will rival an i-pad or galaxy or some other expensive tablet device at a bargain basement price. They are sorely disappointed with the device, and call it \"trash\" or use other demeaning adjectives to describe it. They rate it 1 or 2 stars and generally return it shortly after testing it out.Then there are the third set of reviewers, who are fairly realistic about the capabilities of this $150 machine and purchase it to see if it will meet their needs with or without modification. Some have modified it to increase its capabilities, are satisfied with it, and have kept it. Others find that it does not meet their needs - modified or not - or that its limitations are too great for their planned usage. Generally these reviewers rate it 3 (or so) stars.I am in this last group of reviewers. I read all the reviews prior to purchasing it and decided to test it out and see if I could live with its limitations and whether it would meet my needs. Quite honestly, it surpassed my expectaions as a device and I do believe that it is an excellent bang for the buck. Many of the issues raised by other reviewers (for example the responsiveness of the touchscreen) were non-issues for me. I thought the screen was quite good (though not as good as my HTC Evo). I will not reiterate all of the strengths and weaknesses of the device here as they are clearly depicted in the breadth of reviews on this site. Though the device surpassed my expectations, there are a few limitations that were deal breakers for me and that led me to return the device. The first is wi-fi range. I am using wireless g and this device just did not give me the range I needed in my home (wi-fi range is a known weakness reiterated by many reviewers here; this device would lose connection while my Evo would not). Though I could upgrade my network to accomodate the limited range associated with the device, I am not willing to do so when everything else is working fine. Second, the device does not support Slingplayer (my Evo does and I use it for this purpose all the time). One of my main purposes of purchasing a device like this is to use it to access my Slingbox - and it will not do this. Lastly, it does not support flash and there are many websites from which I access streaming media that require flash and that this device will not run properly. These were all dealbreakers for me. So, in summary, this device offers good bang for the buck and even greater capability if modified using a rooting procedure. It is just not the right device for me.But will it be right for you? Which group of reviewers do you fall in? If the first, you'll love it. If the second, you'll hate it. If the third, like me, give it a test run to see if it will meet your needs.

I decided to pony up and order it, along with a 16G microSD card.Out of the box, it hooked up to my wifi fine (an Airport, BGN), and I was online with it immediately. Appslib is a little limiting, and I wanted Market, so off to root it I go. It was very simple with the help at tipstir dot the-talk dot net, with some help from xda-developers. Google with the model number and \"root\" and you'll trip over the instructions to get it done.I ran the updates from the Coby site, updated AppsLib, then rooted the device and added all the Google apps, including Market, and then AppBrain (which I really like). I initially purchased it as an ebook reader, so I installed FBReader, Kindle, and Nook on it. All are better than the included reader, although it's not bad.  I also installed Dolphin HD as the default web browser.The tablet isn't heavy, the screen is crisp, and after a full charge I ran it unplugged for 6 hours, listening to music, watching YouTube vids, reading, and browsing. That's pretty respectable battery life. Since it is wifi only, I installed Orbot in case I'm out and about and hook into public wifi (for a little added security, no Firesheep here). It says it is connected to Tor, but fails the tests. Oh well, hopefully the team will catch up. Also, the Slingplayer app doesn't seem to be available, but it looks like 7015 owners have already hit the Slingbox site to ask for it.The screen was my biggest concern, as I have no fingernails to speak of. Screen response is a little slow at times, but overall, I shouldn't have been concerned, I've had no problems and it works well. The 7 inch screen is an order of magnitude better than trying to read or browse on my iPhone or iPod Touch. Since it is wifi only and my contract with AT&T; is up next month on the iPhone, I'm thinking of separating my phone habits from my computer habits and getting a Virgin Mifi for on the go with it. Especially since ATT modified my data plan and then wouldn't let me cancel it.Things I like: -lots of them out there, that means a good community for support and easy \"hacks\" for it. -Screen, it's not as tricky as I thought it would be and is easy to operate. -Easier on the eyes than an iPod Touch -It does more than serve as a book reader.Things I don't like: -Out of the box, no Google Market (rooting really made this device). I'm hoping this is corrected when Android 3.0 comes out, as 2.1 is still technically a phone OS. Google states there will be no \"lower limit\" on 3.0, so I'm hopeful. -Facebook App. It didn't come with one, which I really didn't mind, but all of them out there are a bear to un-install after you put them on there and don't add much functionality. Not Coby's fault, but really really annoying. The Dolphin browser is better for browsing FB, so if you are wondering whether you need to install the FB app, don't.I am so pleasantly surprised with this thing. It isn't an iPad, but even this fanboy can't see shelling out that kind of bank for what is essentially a crippled laptop.

Though it does have a fairly good interface for that.The touch screen is very responsive, and you only have to use minimal pressure to get your point across.  It does come packaged with a nice extend-able stylus that has a screw on end-cap lanyard.  Which is a bit on the small side, but nicely portable.  The built in case for it is nice quality.  Held in place by 4 small screws it is removable for those who want to use a different case.  It does however double as a built in stand for hands free video watching.(By simply flipping the top back, and placing the outer clasp back into the holder.) Built in speaker isn't too bad, but a bit on the small side, does get a bit crackly when you max out the volume.On board memory of only 4 gigs is a bit on the small side, but plenty of room there for all the apps you might need.  A secondary SD Card should be used for storage of other media files.I can't rate it's HDMI output, but if you're buying a tablet I'd expect you're not going to plan on tethering it much anyhow.I have found it works great for video watching, music, and even comic book reading by using the right apps.

That is disappointing as I don't feel that I'm getting the full benefit of my tablet.I use my tablet primarily for checking email when none of my PCs are turned on. The tablet works fine for that. It easily discovered my wireless network and connecting was a breeze. It doesn't do well with some email attachments, depending on the format. Applib does offer some help in this area. Responding to emails is easy, as it should be. I still haven't figured out how to create an email from scratch and haven't found a file to place my address book. I was hopeful the full manual would go into that and also address some other questions I have.Because of the lack of the full manual I do not fell I can give this product better than a 3 star rating.

It has barely enough processing power to run Audible and Pandora, but don't expect to be able to use either of these applications in the background while you are doing something else on the pad.

It runs a hamstrung version of Android that allows for very little expansion or inventiveness. But if you're in the least bit tech savvy or can follow concise well written step by step instructions, then this offering from Coby will provide you with an experience that rivals its much more expensive brethren.The key to unlocking the power of this tab is to root it. I won't try to describe the process but suffice to say it is really very easy and adds a tremendous amount of functionality to the tablet. I am now running a very streamlined version of the Honeycomb OS with access to the Google Market and also the Amazon App Store. You can also try the Gingerbread flavor of the OS if so inclined. You can read up in advance of your decision at the excellent forums on android tablets dot net or tipstir the talk dot net. A wealth of helpful information is available.The tablet itself is very sturdy with only 3 buttons to manage and is intuitively laid out. The scree is very readable except in very bright sunlight. It feels very good in the hand and is not unwieldy to hold for long periods of time.Battery life when rooted seems to be in the 5-6 hour range if you turn off unnecessary services. WiFi hookup and signal strength have been very good in our two story house.I would recommend buying a 16GB micro-sd card at the time of your purchase [...]. You'll need it when you root the device and also to hold all your applications and media files. Also, a very good case made for the Samsung Galaxy Tab but works great for the Kyros is the Incipio kickstand [...]. It does ship with a case but you'll need something like this down the road.YouTube videos play great and are stutter free and almost never any buffering. The only drawbacks I can think of is no Flash support and no camera but these weren't deal breakers for me.Update: 7/22/11 - I've subsequently updated this tablet to Gingerbread 2.3.3. and have Adobe Flash 10.3 on it and also Netflix and can play movies without too much buffering. It is much faster than when I had the Honeycomb mod on it and will run most applications fine. I'm not a gamer so I can't attest to its functionality in that realm but other remarks I've read says it does fine. You can go to the new forum, just Google in Kyros Tablet Zone Forums and navigate from there.

It comes with a little faux-leather case that protects it even more.Touch screen uses resistive technology, and as expected, kind of crappy (resistive means NO double touch). It comes also with a small stylus that you took from one side of the device... but when I use the stylus I feel I'm back to Palm Pilot time...The things that makes this device a crappy device are:- slow slow slow. The CPU can't handle too many tasks at the same time. Perhaps is also a memory issue that cause the OS to keep reusing the memory from non-running applications, but it is kind of sluggish to use. It's so slow that the keyboard is so hard to use. When you press (with the crappy resistive touch screen) you get the feedback way too late...- crash crash crash. Get familiar with the RESET button (on the back, you have to take it out of the faux-leather case), because you are going to need it a lot. Learn also (to reduce crash) to turn it OFF every time instead of putting it on standby... you have better chance to have less crashes (boot time is reasonable on the other hand).Few things that can be improved (less critical):- battery usage. Don't expect the battery to last like a smartphone... at its best the batteries last for few hours of continuous usage.- App store missing. You can easily root it and install the Google Marketplace (and with it much more applications). There's an AppsLib store, but it list most of applications in chinese... Most of the apps crash with no apparent reason, and few others appears to run, but has some sort of aberrations on the screen...- Documentation and support from Coby is almost inexistent. I chose to get a Coby instead of a no-brand from Taiwan because I was hoping to get a little bit more. The only thing you get is a nice web page with some instructions to upgrade the firmware of the device (that, by the way, you don't even understand if you need to apply those firmware upgrades or not), that doesn't work...- Micro SD. What the heck? Why Micro? Why not just SD? Micro SD was designed for cellphones, not for large devices like this one.Now the plus:- Amazon Kindle works like a charm, and the screen is very easy to read. I like that!- Cheap. You can probably get it for less than $150...- Sturdy. As I mentioned before, I don't get the feeling of fragility...- HDMI output. I haven't tried to connect, but most of the comparable devices don't have it.- The big front button is for \"BACK\" and not as I would expect \"HOME\". The Home and MENU buttons are grouped together on one long button on the side... Seriously... was it an accident or there's some (unknown to me) logic behind this choice?- No volume button: volume control is only through the buttons on the top bar. Unfortunately when you watch a movie, the top bar disappear (movie plays in full screen), making it impossible to control the volume once the movie player start...- Wi-Fi reception not that great. Compared with other devices (laptops, smartphones) I have, this device probably is the worse.- Android 2.1. Don't know if the upgrade posted at the Coby web site is to upgrade it to 2.2.. they don't mention about version at all (?!?!?)...Technical:- It's a taiwanese hacked product. If you manage to get the product description, you see that is based on a development board (they didn't even changed the description). They took a reference design, and squeeze it into a tablet form factor. Adapted the whatever available device drivers for the OS and push it on the market (that's familiar with all those kind of devices).- If you want a device for programming Android, it's a great tool.

Performs excellent as a book reader with the included Aldiko and hundreds of free classic books available. The screen is very comfortable to read and has a night mode to read in low-light conditions.

It's still on Android 2.1, which is a bit outdated (especially with new tablets coming out later this year with 3.0). The touch screen seems a bit sluggish, but it really isn't; you just need to get used to a resistive touch screen. That said, if you're expecting an iPad experience here, you will be disappointed. The 256MB of RAM on the device can make it a bit sluggish when you have a lot of apps running (but a task killer app can take care of that pretty easily).One thing I feel needs to be mentioned is the lack of the Google Android Market, and all Google apps. Because of this, you cannot easily download the amazon kindle app (which is WAY better than the Aldiko app that is preinstalled). The app store you get on the Coby Kyros is AppsLib, which is vastly inferior to the official android market. Keep that in mind when considering this product.However, there's something else to keep in mind with this: rooting the device is craaaaazy easy to do (under 30 minutes). \"Root\"ing a device, in layman's terms, means you (the human user) has near complete control over the device. Rooting the device will allow you to install the google marketplace and get full access to any app you can dream of! It's easy to do and doesn't require any special technical knowledge (you can find the tutorial online).Before the device is rooted (and therefore, before it has the google apps and market), the Coby Kyros is a 3 star product: good for quick internet access, and AppsLib has a few fun games. But that's about it...After the device is rooted (and has the google apps and official market app store), the Coby Kyros is a 4 star product: being able to have whatever app you want is a big bonus, although the 256MB of RAM makes it occasionally slow. The android market is faster and easier than AppsLib tooAnother review mentioned this, and it must be clearly understood by all potential buyers: this is not an iPad. Don't expect an iPad.

I did this and it immediately fixed the graphics issues.  I then wiped the Kyros and installed a custom Mod (Honeycomb) and the graphics fix was incorporated into this Mod, so no need to run it separately.Coby support for this tablet is terrible, but the community support is impressive - I stick with androidtablets DOT net and tipstir.the-talk DOT net and have gotten all of the help I could possibly want.Custom ROM:  I am running Honeycomb B9 now (Google: \"HoneyComb TC21-HCV955-B9\" and use tipstir's instructions - very easy).  There is also Watery and CyanogenMod, neither of which I've tried - since Cyanogen is Froyo-based, I'm considering giving it a try.Rooting is easy with z4root - just install Clockwork Recovery first and always run a backup prior to installing a fix or a mod.

If you want to install a custom ROM, skip the gapps part as the Google apps will be installed with the ROM.Honeycomb ROM:  Very slick and the Kyros runs MUCH faster on this ROM than the stock ROM.Last note....Coby just released the 8 series (MID 8024) for this device.  It's running a 1GHZ processor and 512MB RAM - much better than the 7.  It also has Android 2.2 instead of 2.1 (big improvement).  I've seen it as cheap as $199, but it looks like it will sell on Amazon for about $237 - If your budget will allow this price, go for the MID 8024 instead - if you need to stick with <$150, then this is a good buy as long as you are willing to root it.

I can honestly say this has been the best performer to-date.  The browser is very quick - faster than you would expect on an inexpensive tablet.  The touch screen is either glass or a hard plastic; truly can't tell.  What I know is it is very sturdy and you don't feel like you are disturbing the device's inner beings.  Plenty of great features (i.e., HDMI, multi-USB cables, headphone and ability to link to your computer and other devices).  Unfortunately there is no camera and I'm uncertain if the Bluetooth works.  Another drawback, like the other inexpensive devices which I have returned, Yahoo and Gmail e-mail cannot be set up.  What a disappointment given the popularity of both!  Additionally, I still have not been able to download Kindle, albeit there is a eBook reader already installed.  Overall I am very pleased with the device and it's reliability.  Getting onto the Internet with its quick browser is actually faster then getting on with my old household Gateway laptop.  If you are looking for an inexpensive, reliable, solid tablet that allows quick Internet access and other value-added features, then you won't be disappointed with this lil' device.

You HAVE to at least download the Slideme market App from their website in order to INSTALL anything on the Tablet - because it does not come with a File Manager!!  The Slideme App then allows you to search and download other Apps (Opera-Mini, EStrong Explorer, Android Explorer, OfficeSuitePro ALL work well with Android 2.1).More advanced users with an Android phone - can use a Google Market App called AndroidMate to 'backup' their downloaded phone App .apk files to the phone's SD card.

It's probably the best purchase I've made without spending a lot of cash. Although many will shun Coby because it's not as well known and make the assumption that cheap things are not good, I would like to give this internet tablet a 4/5. Within' the 2 days I've used it, I guarantee that I will be buying accessories like screen protectors and warranty to protect it as I believe it is worth it. Feature wise - it's really good but can be debatable. I guess below are my pros and cons of this tablet.Pros:-Great price (Around $150)-Great quality (Very durable frame, not some cheap plastic)-Decent touchscreen (It's a resistive touch but is much more sensitive then most)-Runs the Google Android 2.1 OS-Decently fast (Despite the fact that it only is a 800Mhz processor)-Amazingly good battery life (You can max out almost 7-8 hours, depending on what you use it for)-Very nice size (7\" so it can fit in my hand but not too big)-Very nice weight (Feels like the weight of a book)-Comes with a hard-case for your tablet to protect it, headphones, a stylus, and all the USB cables you need.-An attention/conversation starter ;) (Being on book size and running a computer like interface and touchscreen, people asked me a lot about what it was)Cons:-Doesn't have a webcam however the update MID7025 that will be released in March will have one with the Android 2.2 or 2.3 OS-Only supports up to 16GB MicroSD Card (Despite the fact there is a 32GB)-Kinda slow if you don't install the TasKiller app-Instead of the Google Apps store, it has AppLibs, a similar app store, but very low on selection. The only way to bypass this is to root it. Rooting can be very risky but despite that fact, normal users can live with the apps avaliable to them.-Here and there, there is a flash problem loading correctly on some sites. Some people say that it won't load at all, however, I found a way to work around it. You can either install an app or use the SDK if your more familiar with developing programs.-Not as much accessories for it but a way to work around it is to get cases and screen protectors in the same size as your tablet.Overall:The Coby Kyros MID7015 is a great internet tablet for a great price. Most start around $150 so you don't have to bust your pocket for an iPad. There's not many restrictions with this Android tablet, other than the 16GB max support and unavailability of Google App store. However, people who are tech savy will find this tablet a great product if they will overclock the processor, root the tablet, and install Google Apps.With a great frame and sensitive resistive touch screen, most people will find this comparable with the iPad. You can almost do everything on the tablet as you can on the iPad - read books, go on the internet, watch videos, listen to music, play games, and more. The only problem in comparison with the iPad is that the iPad usually comes with a 3G internet plan, therefore, increases the price. If you have a WiFi hotspot or even those thin Wireless 3G routers, you can cut costs left and right compared to the iPad.All and all. This is a great tablet for the price. For those who rant on Amazon rankings about this tablet, don't set your expectation to the sky. If I had $50 more, I would definitely buy a warranty plan on it, instead of getting a better one with the Android system. There's not as much as I can as this is a great tablet, and I definitely intend to keep it for a year or so.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Before rooting: 1 star.

It will play HD avi movies better than most desktop computers.The only problem I have with this player is it uses the first frame of the video as an icon for the clip,it does not seem to have any method of displaying the file name.The music player plays mp3s fine and has a good system of displaying by artist, albums or songs.The internal speakers are not good for music but the headphones do OK.When you connect to a computer you must mount the drives before you can access then from the computer. When a drive is mounted you cannot accesss it from the Kyros.To put music or videos into the machine simply copy them to the internal memory, or put them on the SD card. The player will find them.To but books into the Kyros you must follow the directions for importing books. Found by going to Aldikothe pressing the settings button (right side of home button).The keyboard needs to be calibrated. There is an included program to do this. It only takes a few seconds and makes a huge difference.The only major problems I have so far: You cannot load the Kindle app so you cannot read kindle books.(Nook can be loaded).You cannot load Netflix.

For starters, it is said to have a resistive screen.  Well, if this is resistive, then I'm not ready for one that is not.  It responds well (sometimes too well) to a finger touch.  And it browses the internet well.  I also rooted it (which was really easy) so I was able to get the andriod market and google apps.  Plus there is also now the amazon apps.  And rooting it is soooo easy.  I was convinced that I would turn it into a $140 brick, but I didn't and I can give you personal references that still can't believe I did it right.  So I highly recommend rooting to get the optimum experience, but if you don't there are still a ton of apps that come with it.  The speed is also good.  Of course, most of it depends on how strong your wireless signal is.  Just like with any wireless device.  I only gave the Kyros four stars because I have only had it for a week, so I haven't really had it long enough to run into any problems, but I deducted a star for time.  I really don't think you could find a better bang for your buck.  I was realistic and kept my expectations low (because I wasn't willing to shell out for the iPad and like devices) and so it was everything I expected and more.  Most of the bad reviews come for people who have the 7005, got a dud (which is fully refundable/exchangable), or wanted the iPad experience...and in my opinion, the iPad is too big and has too many added things.  I have a camera, so I don't need one on my tablet.  I also have my kindle for reading, so that wasn't important to me.  You can't buy a $140 dollar tablet and expect it to perform like it costs $700...if you keep that in mind, you will find that the Kyros is a great deal.  I would have expected it to cost more.  So if you're hesitating, go ahead, it's worth it.  P.S.  Battery life is good too...I can get half a day out of it if I'm not on the internet.:)  And the kids love it.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome for the price but be careful of the main memory", "Author": "Fabian Vargas", "ReviewID": "R2049F5DNBXVUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only write reviews if I have something important to say. In this case the Coby Kyros MID7015 7-Inch Android  Internet Touchscreen Tablet - Black is a great product for the price. As other people have mentioned you should root it to really make the best of it. The battery life is not the best, the device can be laggy and unresponsive some times but for the price it's totally worth it.So what's the problem then? The main memory, it's only 256 Mb..I have two Android phones, a Froyo (Android 2.2) with 150 Mb of memory and an Eclair (Andriod 2.1) with 100 Mb. of memory. For the Froyo I use app2sd to move the apps to the SD card and for the Eclair I use link2sd. Still it's a pain to be moving apps but well... it works.I bought the coby knowing everything there is to know about it beforehand except that the 4 Gb of memory are not the main memory. Apprently you get 256 Mb of main memory and about 2.7 Gb of nand memory. The apps install on the main memory so thanks to Amazon's awesome appstore I filled that up yesterday.So, the coby has Eclair so app2sd doesn't work. I tried link2sd but you need to make a second partition on your memory card (which I did for the Eclair phone and worked great) but when I do it for the coby the coby won't recognize the card. Not the first nor the second partition.There's a cyanogen mod ROM floating around that I can install but you lose some functionality like WATCHING VIDEOS, I'm not gonna sacrifice watching videos so that not a option.There are some instructions to try to get app2sd working on a huawei S7 that they say might work on the coby with some modification but they're very complicated and not even designed for the coby so don't wanna risk it.This has been very dissapointing for me. What good are the thousands of apps if we can't install them? Coby has said they will not release a 2.2 update for this tablet so that sucks.Still the tablet is awesome for the price, if you wanna do the normal stuff and install just a few apps it's great. It's super easy to root.If any one knows how to fix this memory space problem please let me know.UPDATE: I forgot to mention one thing, a lot of people complain about the wifi reach. I was very worried about this since my LG GW620 phone barely gets wifi in my room, like if I stand near the door it gets like 1 bar, when I'm at my desk or bed it may or may not connect. Now the coby always connects, all the time and usually has 2 bars so actually it has worked great for me. I'm sure other devices have better connection but in my case the Coby worked even better than expected.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Coby Kyros 7015... not a bad device", "Author": "Lomonster", "ReviewID": "R3FF1UDZFRGZYP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the Coby Kyros 7015 for about a week now and thought I'd share my experience thus far.  To start off,  I think it is important to note why I purchased this device.  I was looking for an eReader that did the Kindle format (by research I found that Kindle has more of the books I like and want than the other major online book stores), ePub (so that I could check out eBooks from the public library), and Adobe Reader (so that I could read work PDF documents without having to print reams of paper). All of this in a 7 inch screened device that fits nicely in one hand. Unfortunately no one dedicated eReader could do this and a more expensive tablet was not in the cards right now.  Then,  I stumbled across the Kyros (while researching the Xoom) and thought,  why not?  Well,  let's be up front here,  I knew that to get the functionality I needed/wanted from the Kyros it would have to be rooted and the Google App Market would need to be placed on it (please note,  I am not advocating that anyoone should ever root their droid, please research before you take this step,  it could render your device useless and void your warranty).  Which leads me to ...... My rooting experience.  When I first opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised that the Kyros did not feel or look like a piece of junk.  I followed directions and fully charged the tablet,  then Googled directions on how to root.  All went well until (as I found out by reading the tail end of the blog) that with the new firmware update that ships on the Kyros 7015,  the instructions are lacking.  Luckily,  as things have it,  someone else had figured out how to get around that and voila,  I was rooted.  For a first time rooter (is that the word?) I completed the task in about one and a half hours.Now with Google App Market loaded,  I began my Kyros experience.  I was able to load Kindle onto my tablet and it worked flawlessly.  Check.  I then loaded Adobe Reader and again it worked flawlessly.  Check.  Lastly,  I started the preloaded Aldiko reader and found I had to upgrade to 2.0 so that I could authorize Adobe DRM protection (necessary for DRM protected library books you check out). With Aldiko 2.0 loaded I ran into my first problem.  For some reason I could not (for the life of me) get library books to work with Aldiko.  Spent about 2 hours on this and then went for the work around.  I loaded Overdrive.  Overdrive works great with EPub books I check out from the library and Overdrive Audio books as well (a plus).  I could not, however,  get Adobe PDF eBooks to download from the libraries.  Not a major deal,  but I'd like the full breadth of content available to me from my libraries card catalog. (Side Note,  I easily got all types of library books to work on my Droid phone,  so it is a definite platform difference).  I have spent some time on this (trying various browsers, etc), but to no avail.  Another review says \"the Kyros is not an ereader\", and I agree.  However,  it does pretty good at it, and considering I can get more out of the eReader part of it than Kindle,  I'm happy.  It is slightly heavier than a Kindle or comparable device from another major bookstore, so please keep that in mind.Many of you out there may have a Droid phone.  Please note,  that the newer Droid phones running 2.2 and above are much better than this tablet,  so don't expect the same experience you'd get from your Droid X or Droid Incredible.Things you may NOT like:- The touch screen.  I found that the stylus is best for navigating (although you can use your finger) and your finger is best for typing. (Resistive touch screen)- Not all apps work flawlessly.  I believe that is why Coby may try to limit the apps to their apps library.- I use Tunesynch to synch my iTunes with my Droid and found that although my music pulls over,  my playlists do not work properly.  I did try a couple of other music players and found the same issue.- No Flash support.  (Android 2.1)Other things you may like:- Videos on the Kyros are beautiful.  I really enjoy that functionality.- Many of the games I've tried work well.All in all,  I am pleased with the performance to cost ratio of this tablet.  If you don't want to fork over the money for a better tablet,  this one is good for a somewhat limited Droid experience.  And,  as an eReader,  it is not bad.***Update***About a month after purchasing the Kyros I have had the chance to use the tablet and want to share my experiences.  On a recent flight I was able to watch about two movies (using mVideoPlayer downloaded from the App Market) and read a bit of an eBook before the battery died.I never did figure out how to get Adobe PDF eBooks to download after checking them out from the library.I also have given up on using my Kyros for my audio playlists.  The Kyros plays music just fine,  my issue has been in how it is reading my playlists (which it isn't) and synching it with iTunes.  All of my music is there and plays just fine,  but when I go to the playlist imported from iTunes there are no songs listed under it.  I'm sure this is an easy thing to remedy,  but since this is low on my priority list and I have my Droid phone to play music (which synchs just fine with iTunes) it is not high on my list of items to fix.Last,  I recommend getting a screen protector for your Kyros as it picks up finger smudges quickly.  I picked up my screen protector at a major \"Brick and Mortar\" bookseller that is made for their Nook eReader.  It covers the viewable area of the touchscreen on my Kyros almost perfectly and have been very happy with it.  The downside is that the touchscreen is a little less sensitive and I find myself using the stylus more.  Also,  the ones I purchased were way too expensive and so hopefully someone else will blog a less expensive alternative.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't let most \"helpful\" reviews sway your opinion.", "Author": "Kristy", "ReviewID": "R393NHQIR89XT0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Truthfully, I think one must really play with a device themselves before purchasing. I originally wanted to buy a new graphics card with my money, but instead I bought this tablet...With that being said, I was looking forward to being able to play Netflix and perhaps other apps like that because I own a droid phone and when I sit outside and watch Netflix with my phone it really drains the battery. So I wanted something dedicated to it.I thought this tablet would be a good idea, it looked nice and I was swayed by the MOST HELPFUL reviews, which WERE NOT actually that helpful. The carrier had already updated the tablet but it didn't come with a manual, USB chord, or a little screen cleaner. But the rest was there.If you plan on purchasing this, I would suggest only for simple apps and mobile site browsing. I found that it kept crashing whenever I tried to run apps that wasn't supported. And it crashed whenever running Crunchyroll (similar to Netflix except it's Anime and Asian Dramas). And the Appslib NO LONGER IS SIGNED WITH COBY. So you have to go to a certain site and download Getjar, which did not even work for me. I resulted to installing Amazon Apps and only using the apps they have. Which in my opinion suck because there are no foreign language keyboards, and it's very limited UNLESS you want to pay for apps.The battery is also weird, I would leave it charging until I see that the light is green and I would check it on the screen and it would say 98%. Whenever I open Advanced Task Killer (ideal app if you have/are going to purchase this) it would say about 95%.And the battery life seems to be nearly 3 hours if you play music and occasionally use a messenger, but I can't be all that sure. So I think the battery is either weird or worn out because I'm using a used one. Also, the touch screen is a bit hard to get used to if you are used to smartphones, I end up just using the stylus about 90% of the time. The earphone jack and SDCard slot are also weird. You have to shove it in with force, or else it will be sticking out (the earphones) or it can't read your SDCard.**Also: The tablet occasionally freezes for me, if I press a lot of buttons (like if I'm typing fast or just putting something like \"aaaaah\") or sometimes it just freezes and after it does that it will automatically reboot itself. The first time it died on me(which I'm not sure if it actually even DIED or just messed up because battery said 38%~ on Task killer) I kept trying to turn it back on after charging it for a bit and it didn't work. So I had to turn it over and reset it. So if it doesn't seem to cut on just hit the reset button on the back, you don't lose any data or anything. I actually don't know why it's there, but assuming because it's there can't be very good lol.My guess is the only way to get a good use out of this tablet is to \"root\" it, which I believe is illegal. But if you are willing to go that far, I think that even updates your tablet's system and allows it to run Angry Birds without graphic issues.In my opinion, I'm conflicted, I like using it for a messenger, playing simple games and browsing. But it can't do what I originally bought it for.So if you are looking for something that will play Netflix or anything alike, you will have to spend nearly 299$+.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good choice for younger kids", "Author": "kyros_user", "ReviewID": "R3226REOKSPZ3Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for my 10-year old daughter.

This is a perfect device if you surf the web, connect with friends, family and business through social media (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare), peruse YouTube, listen to music, view videos, access Appslib Apps, check and respond to emails, read e-Books via the Aldiko reader, access the web through WiFi connectivity and view videos in 1080p HD on your TV via HDMI cable. The Kyros Tablet has a 7\" resistive screen and runs on Android 2.1. It's a pretty decent device.This device is a lot more than your average eBook reader. Many eBook readers, don't have color, application support and don't run on Android OS. This device does have the eReader functionality and more with Wifi connectivity. Its priced about the same as a good eReader and you can do a lot more. Its pretty light in your hands, has a good feel to it. The screen is a lot easier to view than an iPhone or small Android phone, and is good for reading and viewing videos while not having to squint. The ability to check your email, socialize, surf the web, listen to music and watch videos make this device a quality buy.Most people nowadays enjoy surfing the web, socializing, watching YouTube clips and listening to music on their device of choice. The popularity of Android, iPhones and iPad device's is due to peoples desire to connect socially in these ways. If your looking for a full blown computer non of these will meet your needs. A Netbook or a phone like the Atrix (which turn into a Mobile PC when you connect the Lapdock) may be what you need. Android and iPhone devices are for the casual social networker.Having had a iPhone and now an Android Tablet, I don't see the difference other than one is open source and the other is connected to iTunes software. I prefer open source and don't like iTunes software to manager my .mp3 collection which I've had since mp3.com was free before it was closed down and changed. I don't want to have to rename the way I've done things for years. I prefer to drag and drop files into my phone or device and not have to hassle with software and the conversion process necessary to switch to iTunes only world.Some of the stock features are an alarm clock, calendar, calculator, gallery for viewing videos and photo's, email account access, mobile YouTube browser, Aldiko eBook Reader, and AppsLib. The AppsLib is limited, you have some of your basic apps and games but not the who 180,000 Apps in the Google Marketplace for those who want the full access to Google Marketplace Rooting your device is the way to go.Rooting Your TabletYou can upgrade the OS and add Google Marketplace if you do a Google search for Rooting your tablet. This is key to having access to core Google apps and the Google Marketplace.I used Android Tablets, XDA Developers and YouTube to figure out how to Root the device. I had been looking at a few other Android Tablets, including the Cruz Tablet among other. I decided on this one because I saw that once you rooted it you can access the entire Google marketplace and apps. I saw a few good reviews and decided I go with this device and root it.Once you root your device and get Super User access you can load the Google marketplace and make changes to your device that the retailers of your device didn't give you. This is a pretty easy process. If you run into issues both XDA Developers and Android Tablets have forums and helpful people who will gladly help you root your device.Essential Android App's  To View My List Go to my profile and click on the link to my website and search for this full version of this review.Personal Favorite App's for Android  To View My List Go to my profile and click on the link to my website and search for this full version of this review.What Come In The BoxYou get the Tablet, course, it also comes with a pleather case, stylus, usb cable, usb host cable, earphones and a power adapter. The nicest things is the faux leather case which you normally have to buy separate. Its also nice to have a stylus to be able to select items on the capacitive screen. You can use your finger tips as well. One item that doesn't come in the case that I ordered separate is a external keyboard and a mini-USB connector so that you can type faster. I've heard people who advocate touch screen typing. In this Twitter/Facebook Status update and texting world I can see how touch screen typing came be useful. If you use your tablet to socialize, surf the web, watch YouTube clips, listen to music and text then touch screen if the way to go. If you, like me, are a serious writer your used to a full QWERTY keyboard then you will want to get an external plug in keyboard so you can type and write. It make better use of the time. There are a few keyboard apps if you want larger keys on the screen.Specs OverviewComes with a 800 MHz CPU and built in 4GB storage. Supports up to 32 GB micro-SD card. Features a 7\" Resistive Touch Screen Display with a 800 X 400 Resolution. Supports 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks. Includes a headphone out, built in speaker and video output that supports 1080P and 720P. With micro-USB host support for keyboard and mouse.OverviewThe device is good for those of you who want to surf the web, socialize, watch YouTube, listen to music, read books and enjoy entertainment at your fingertips utilizing WiFi connectivity. As device go its pretty good. I like it better than the iPhone and it gets the job done. If you're a writer like me you will want to get a keyboard.Update: I received my Cover with Micro USB Keyboard and it works perfectly I plugged it in and it plays I have a full qwerty keyboard and it looks like a miniature laptop.

I was thinking about getting a kindle, but when I saw this PC tablet for the same amount of money, I figured I'd take a chance on it.This is a great item.  I am able to get books from Kindle AND I can surf the web, check email and watch videos on YouTube!  I also got free apps (Many you can also get in the Amazon Android Apps Store!--For such things as weather, horoscopes, movie showtimes, wikipedia and dictionary.com), Plus! I can listen to police scanners and radio stations from around the world!  I just use a wire from the tablet and hook it up to my aux on my boombox and can hear this stuff loud and clear!The tablet also comes with a very nice, pleather case, which you can fold back and use as a stand for the tablet, for when you want to watch youtube.One thing this pc tablet is unable to utilize is flash.  BUT, there is a way around this!  You can download a free browser called SKYLINK.  With this browser, it encodes MOST flash video into HTLM5--Which lets you watch video on MANY sites.  Some of the video can be highly pixeled with \"bleeding\" colors.  It has worked GREAT on the CNN site and with movie trailers.  FYI--DO NOT select SKYLINK as your default browser--for it messes up getting YouTube on this tablet.  Also, if you are looking for a tablet with a GPS, this won't be the tablet for you to purchase.

I prefer APPOKE but they both work well so with the applib included on the device I am all set. I downloaded the APPOKE and ANDAPPS from their website and it installed right away almost by magic... I found the Dolphin HD on APPOKE and it is a great browser... just a few little gitches with windows live but still very good and it has FLASH, as does OPERA MOBILE. I do not see why I would root the device now that this is all set. I also use NIMBUZZ and it is a great app for all win messenger, skype, gtalk and facebook social networking....

I'm still waiting.  So they were very prompt to send the product and get my money but they do not provide any type of service (technical or customer).

Of course, wifi was turned off in the aircraft, battery life would have been considerably shorter if wifi were on.  Screen is bright and sharp and easy to see.

Worked for me on the first try.On the negative side, customer support is non-existent.  I emailed a question three weeks ago and haven't received a reply yet.  I tried calling the customer support number and there is no selection for the Kyros.  The touch screen is at times too sensitive and other times not sensitive enough.  Kyros owners have no access to the Android Market, so you can not get the best apps out there, only demo and trial versions and apps that weren't good enough for the Android Market.  I downloaded a demo version of an app and want to purchase the full-featured version but can't because it has to be purchased through the Android Market.

The Coby was a good choice because it's a cheap holdover until the next generation tablets come out this year.  After some easy modifications, this tablet presents the best bang for your buck functionality.  I was a little worried about the touchscreen and wifi performance after reading the reviews here and other places, but I'm happy to report those are non-issues for me.  Getting the Google marketplace is pretty easy once you have the correct instructions.  There's a ton of advice out there on how to root your device, but if you have the latest firmware (7015A) use these instructions:[...]Most of the instructions out there won't work for the most recent update, including the popular youtube video.If you don't want to root, and I didn't initially, you can still get Marketplace apps if you have an Android phone.  Just get an app backup from the Marketplace, back-up the apps you want, transfer the files to your PC, and then from your PC to your Kyros.  Then, use a file manager to find the file on your Kyros and install it.  I installed a bunch of apps this way but found it a pain after a while, so ended up just rooting it.  Using the instructions from the above link, it takes an hour or so, so not too bad.  And you only need to use your PC for one step, otherwise everything can be done from the tablet itself.  I would recommend rooting to get the full Android experience.Overall this is a great bargain tablet, but keep your performance expectations in check.  The specs on the machine aren't that great so it's no surprise the tablet bogs down when performing multiple functions.  The screen isn't as vibrant as the more expensive tablets, but that's fine.  I can check my gmail, facebook, surf, Kindle, watch movies, play music and games just fine.  Only thing missing I would normally use is a GPS but what do you expect for $150.

I have learned to deal with that on phones, but they have to be small to fit in your pocket.  Otherwise this product was much better than I expected for such an inexpensive product.  I see a lot of tablets for sale with that same screen format, but for me you had to scroll around too much to be able to see a full web page.

So, you need to use a stylus to navigate around the screen.The screen is not actually white, it's more of a bright gray.Using the fingernail or stylus is very tedious.

I found it tiring to try to do simple things like using Google to find Android items or looking for things at Amazon.com.I know the price is next to nothing nowadays, but what makes this a dealbreaker is that the screen is sooo sooo hard to navigate with the stylus or your finger, and the color of the screen is dark especially compared to the iPhone, which is going for $49 for a comparable model. Granted it's 7\" display, which is larger, but what good is that when it's such a pain to navigate around?

As a self-deemed \"Android Power User,\" I was less than impressed. For anyone else, it would work just fine.The stock OS has a very low pixel density, so everything on the screen is huge. Perhaps the only redeeming feature of the stock OS is that it can be turned on and rooted in less than 3 minutes. There is plenty of stuff on the internet, namely xda-developers forum, that has step-by-step walkthroughs for loading a newer ROM onto it. It also has trouble recognizing any blank SD cards. I found the workaround for that is to shut the unit off, insert the SD card, then reboot the system so that it can initialize it at startup. Any other time just gives a \"Blank SD Card\" warning, and the \"Format SD Card\" function is useless.The hardware itself is nice, the unit feels very solid and well-built. The resistive touchscreen can be a little persnickety sometimes, but it gets the job done. The system has an 800MHz (really ~750MHz) that will under-clock itself to save power. At idle, the system runs at around 100-125MHz. It also has 256MB of RAM, not much to say. It supposedly has 4GB of storage, however, about 1.8GB are somehow missing, I assume taken up by system files, but Android doesn't have that large a footprint. Oh well, an 8GB MicroSD card was $14 here on Amazon, so no trouble. My only gripe about the hardware, is the lack of USB charging support. The tablet can only be charged through a small jack with a wall-wart transformer.Overall, the tablet before an OS upgrade gets an \"ew,\" and after, it gets a resounding \"meh.\" It works just fine with Aldiko, I haven't tried to watch any videos on it yet, but it supposedly works well with mVideoPlayer.

I contacted Coby about it and they said that it was a known issue and that I would have to install the software update for it from the website. In order to do the update, I have to go \"buy a Micro SD card larger than 2GB to load the update. It won't do the update without having one.\"  So in order to fix a defective device buy Coby, I had to go buy a SD card to load the software into it since it didn't come with one.  Then after doing the update, it is still running very slow and locking up but they won't replace it under the warranty just for it freezing up and now even with the app library upgrade too, that keeps force closing so you can't even download your apps back onto it from having to reset it when updating the software.  How insane is that????  The device is defective obviously if the update still doesn't fix it and yet I can't get it fixed with the warranty.  I definately recommend DO NOT BUY!!

The size is fantastic in that its a signifcantly improved viewing experience over the 4.3 inch Droid X screen (which is also great) and it is easy to hold with one hand and navigate with the other - an added bonus is that it also fits in a suit coat pocket.The Microsoft Exchange integration with email/calendar/contacts is seemless and allows for almost all of the functionality provided via a laptop. One of the drawbacks of the iPad is its poor integration with Outlook (couldn't delete, move emails while one a plane working offline - not a problem with the Tab).The screen is gorgeous, speed is quick and the Google location services (GPS, Latitude, Maps, Place and the list goes on and on) are fantastic.I would highly recommend this product.Update - after 1 week of ownership, I love it even more.  As someone who travels (4 cities over last 5 days), I'm considering leaving my notebook home on business travel with future trips.  The benefits of the form factor can't be overstated - it fits in my jeans pocket when out casually and in my suit jacket during business.  It also smartly switches from WiFi to 3G when a WiFi network is not within reach and vice versa (so that you don't unnecessarily consume data via your cellular carrier).

Meunier", "ReviewID": "R3RIFWSGHL8GWL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Review update: Initially my belief was that Samsung has crippled this device, but in fact it has been done by Verizon. The Verizon web site explains that NONE of their mobile devices includes the ability to use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse. Moreover, the T-Mobile model has been reported to work fine with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. I also briefly tested a Sprint model with a Bluetooth mouse, and it seems as though it should work -- there was a menu option to connect to the mouse and use it as a HID (human input device), an option that is not even available on the Verizon model. I wasn't actually able to connect to the mouse, but it's possible that it was a mouse incompatibility issue (it's a Targus N2953), or my batteries were too low.Steer clear of the Verizon model of the Galaxy Tab. And since this review is under the heading of the T-Mobile model of the Tab, I am changing my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.I'm surprised Samsung lets Verizon do this, owing to the bad press it's giving Samsung.Original post follows.----------It's an amazing little tablet. Quick, responsive, light, bright screen, and all the Android apps I've tried run very well on it. It even works as a WiFi-to-3G hotspot out of the box. This tablet is impressive. Too bad it's been deliberately crippled by Samsung [edit: it was Verizon, not Samsung].The problem is Bluetooth, which on the Galaxy Tab is usable ONLY for file transfers (the supplied USB cable is used for the same thing). The ability to use the Tab with Bluetooth HIDs (human input devices) has been DISABLED. Google put it into Android, and Samsung [edit: no, Verizon] took it out. That means you can't use wireless keyboards or mice with it. This tablet has the ability to replace a PC if only it could use a keyboard and a mouse (but then that's probably why Samsung [Verizon] has disabled it: politics, lawsuits, myopia, inbreeding, whatever). I have also tried 3rd party Bluetooth drivers, but they don't work. Not yet, anyway.Bluetooth headsets are also reported not to work, but what's the point? Samsung [edit: might really be Samsung] has also disabled the Tab's phone capability.European users do not have these restrictions placed on them by Samsung [edit: by whomever]: their units work well with keyboards and mice, and as phones. Check YouTube for some videos of this.From the technologizer web site:\"Will the Galaxy Tab support Bluetooth HID? Will it support Bluetooth headsets or keyboards?No, and no, said Kim Titus, a Samsung representative. Looks like Samsung's keyboard dock accessory is your only option.\"[edit: T-Mobile & Sprint users should be able to use Bluetooth HID with no problem.]My advice? Should BT HID remain unattainable (I'll report back if I can find a way to fix it), resist the burning temptation to buy this beautiful and extremely usable but very expensive tablet, and wait a few months for the 7\" tablet competition to ramp up [OR get the T-Mobile or Sprint model] -- there are several on the horizon. Features on other tablets will increase in number, and prices will drop. Apple will release the iPad 2 in 2011, which will undoubtedly have a camera and other nice features you've been waiting for (the iPad already supports the Apple BT keyboard, but no mouse). Samsung will eventually cave in and provide BT HID support in a software update for the Galaxy Tab, but it will be too late.

Only one thing I can really point out is the internet with this device on carrier 3g network. I gave it four stars for it for that reason. The internet is horribly slow. IThe internet can also drop as well. Thats why wifi comes in all the way. Very fast on Wifi. As for games is really great. I usually have all my movies and tv shows on itunes, so theres no need to buy any from the media hub unless theres a reason if my show or movie isn't specified on itunes. The box comes in black. A set of headphones, the tablet, and a few manuals. There is no case or cover which left me disappointed about it. Samsung should have least put cases in the boxes just like t-mobile and their mobile devices. Battery power is awesome. Charged very fast charging. From a half a charge in about an hour. I'd say two hours for a full charge. As for camera, it's no that bad. As for orientation portrait and landscape mode, it is a little sluggish when turning the tablet either way. I'd say that I am waiting for honeycomb update for the tablet itself to experience the full force of a tablet. 2.2 is a good build on it, just not perfectly set for the tablet. There are apps that aren't adjusted for it. But all developers will jump on track as soon as this tablet sells more often. Thats it for my review. Its a great tablet.

But to say the very least is that the movies on the media hub is a little more expensive. Like the dark knight almost 17.99. Others 19.99. And the itunes price 8.99 movies. I would say to use itunes than media hub. Does not support call capabilities. North America strip that from the tab when it crossed into the states. Does support texts. You can get unlimited. If you want to root your device for the call capability there is a site for it. But I wouldn't recommend right now considering the device it is still new.December 7, 2010Sorry Im a bit late on my replies, just been busy for the holidays.WIFI TETHERINGEveryones been asking me about the mobile connection with the galaxy tab internet usage. Well here it is.As this have been a month of playing with my tab, its been surprisingly good. Though I am still waiting for Honeycomb in early next year.  Internet connections using the Galaxy Tab: I have just recently used the internet connection for this device under settings: Wireless & Networks; Mobile Ap. This activates the wifi on the device for internet use for mobile and/ or laptops. This is more faster than 3g network and is free. I tried this using my Nexus One and MacPro. Connections were good. I usually have internet at home, so I think this is a feature to burn up your tablets life quicker. Or unless you want to pay $9.99 from T-Mobile or $14.99 for tethering. Added extra updates:  Music: As for the music, it is loud and clear to understand. I used DoubleTwist to download my music fast and convenient. The music app separates your music into the categories of artists the songs that go under them.  As for game loft games, the Hd is superior on it. [...] for more games for the galaxy tab. You do have to pay for them, $4.99 or you can have it charged on your phone bill after you downloaded the demo game. The game is fully downloaded into the tablets memory card 16gb. You just have to buy it if you are interested in the expansion of the rest otherwise uninstall. I only have Asphalt. The thing about this game is that when your driving, the steering wheel seems to stop turning therefore, you crash into a wall or turning around. Using the sensor was a bit difficult for me.  So some game controls from gameloft is a bit sluggish, but its still good.  Slacker Radio: This app is pretty good when it comes to listening to music. You can upgrade for the full version or just keep the demo. The demo, you do have options of switching stations only six times, then you would have to wait an hour to change them again. Though this app will sometimes take awhile to load the radio station thats because its the demo app. One month: $4.99 or $3.99 monthly thats $47.88 annually. You don't have song lyrics in the demo and there are ads.This device is just a magnet for fingerprints, Luckily I have a spare nylon cloth.More Updates coming soon.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Android Tablet in the market at the time of this review", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "R2KB9T0EVINE36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Technology is a never ending race: you buy something today, probably you'll find something equal or better in six months or so. That also applies to the Samsung Galaxy.

I've being using the GT for over of 3 weeks and had zero problems since then, no crashes, no complains. It is running Froyo by factory (Android 2.2) so you can also browse pages with Flash. I've downloaded lot of Android Applications and they run perfect on Froyo and for this screen: Angry Birds, Kindle, Nook for Android, Kobo, Poker, you name it.Now, please keep your expectations clear. This is not a toy (not cheap) and not an e-reader, I repeat, this is not a dedicated e-reader. So I find really unfair those that get a GT just for reading books and later are complaining about battery life. Yes you can, but there is much more potential on this device and the battery life is not suitable for long reading sessions or outdoors like Sony or Kindle, even though I noticed that with moderate to heavy usage it last the whole business day without a charge ( 8 to 10 hrs)The bad-Expensive-Locked for phone calls in USA (you can flash the firmware, but you will be on your own, and I believe it only works for the AT&T; model)-Ok battery lifeIf you are looking for a nice complement to your eink device and a something that you can use as an extension of your office  computer, besides reading or for fun, this is the perfect device. It keeps you in contact with the outside world while traveling, thanks to the 3G, but you will have the versatility of a tablet on your hands; iPads are too big and eink readers don't do color.Mine is a Tmobile version and I got it without a contract. I suggest anyone to do the same. I pay around 30 bucks or so for 3G access but I can drop it at anytime without penalty.

It is unlocked, and all the functions such Bluetooth are fully operational.  This is not a review by an IT pro, but simply an end-user's initial thoughts after a week of using the machine.I put off buying an iPad because it seemed to be just an oversize iPod without the functionality of a laptop.  I reckon that Samsung has produced exactly the machine that the iPad should have been.  It has all the bells and whistles, including front facing and rear facing cameras, Bluetooth, internet, wireless, GPS, micro-SD slot, etc, etc - oh, and it's a really good cellphone.  The Android 2.2 operating system is terrific and seems to be as intuitive as the Apple OS. I have all sorts of documents loaded on the Tab including Pdf's, Word, jpegs, etc and they all open easily.  The screen is sharp and is easy to read even in sunlight.  The email function is really good, and attachments open without a problem.  I have not tried the video function yet, so I cannot comment on that.  However, the camera is nothing to rave about,as the resolution is pretty grainy, but I didn't buy the Tab to take photos. The virtual keyboard is responsive and easy to use, however the unit is too large to do typing with both hands,and anyway, I plan to get a Bluetooth key board for use in the office.  I have not tried the rear facing camera, but will do so as soon as I can load Skype.  All in all, this seems to be a well-designed, quality built piece of kit.

Both of these tablets seemed well constructed and responsive to me.  The iPad has a slight edge over the Galaxy Tab in its touch screen functions (pinch zoom, etc.), but both work very smoothly overall.  The biggest problem for me with the iPad was its lack of a real USB connectivity.  With the Galaxy Tab, one can simply connect it to a computer with the supplied cable and mount it as a disk.  iPad does not have this convenience; getting data in and out of an iPad is cumbersome at best (think of it as a large iPod Touch and you get the idea).  Also, there is no external storage on the iPad while the Galaxy Tab accepts microSD cards.  The iPad's larger screen can be an advantage when viewing magazines, newspapers, etc., but it is really to large for an eReader.  As an eReader, it is pretty flappy and tiring to hold after a short time.  Galaxy Tab excels in this area.  Apps are better at this time for the iPad; many Android apps are cell phone oriented and appear as a little rectangle in the middle of a big screen.  Probably this will change as Android evolves, but the advantage goes to iPad at the moment.  What it comes down to is personal preference.  The smaller size and easier use as an eReader make the Galaxy my preference; you may prefer the iPad.  But, don't be misled--tablets are not PCs!  If you had planned on all of the niceties of, say, Microsoft Office--well, they just aren't there.  Tablets work fine for email, web browsing, viewing most documents, etc., but they simply do not work well at all when more \"heavy duty\" processing is required.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superb tablet. iPad simply cannot match it.", "Author": "Sajid Ansari", "ReviewID": "R1V0DHZ00WOFF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the T-Mobile version because it has more internal storage (16 GB vs 2 GB) than the other networks' versions, but wirelessly tether it (for free) to my HTC EVO on the Sprint network and avoid a monthly bill and a contract.  I did a ton of research and spent a lot of time deciding between the two before I made a final decision on the Galaxy Tab vs the iPad.  I played around with each device for several hours and went through each and every feature with a fine tooth comb to ensure I was making the right call.  Here are the highlights of what I found:At first, I much preferred the bigger screen of the iPad vs the Galaxy tab.  It seemed to generally make the web browsing experience a little better having the big screen and bigger keyboard.  However, after using the two extensively, I ended up liking the smaller, more compact Galaxy because the iPad is too big to type two handed by holding it, and it is too small to type on like a regular keyboard.  With the Galaxy tab, you type on it like you would a big cell phone, which isn't a bad thing...it makes it easier to two-thumb type when holding vertically which is difficult to do on the bigger screen of the iPad.  The smaller, more compact design also makes the Galaxy easier to carry, as it fits easily in my suit pocket, and even the pocket of a pair of jeans.  Ergonomically, after extensive use, I think most would find the more compact Galaxy much better and comfortable.Then comes the operating system.  I find the iOS that runs the iPad is simpler and generally more responsive and smoother than the Android OS that runs the Galaxy Tab.  For many people who just want to get to the point, they may appreciate the simplicity of the iOS.  However, I much prefer the Android OS for the same reasons I switched from the iPhone to the Evo with the Android OS.  iOS is very bland, boring, stale, and juvenile compared to the Android OS, which in contrast is FAR more capable, customizable, and fitting to personal use.  Apple controls everything on the iOS and locks everything set in stone, making the experience very plain.  Android OS however makes the device unique, and personal which I love.Some features that are on Android that are not on the iOS are:Expandable storageFree navigation built in to the phone with google maps (seems useless if you have a navi in your car, but this works so much faster and easier to look up addresses and POI's...I use this exclusively over my car's navi because it is much faster and easier to use)One-touch navigational shortcuts.  Touch one button to go home, work, airport, wherever you defineWidgets.  These are icons on the homescreen that provide shortcuts to just about anything on your phone, such as your clock, weather, calendar, wifi, ringtone profiles, favorites for calling (see picture)True multi-tasking.  Apple has made an attempt to do so, but doesn't compare to the integration that Android has done and allows for multiple apps like skype, pandora, etc to run in the background.Customizable in so many ways, but most importantly in ergonomics like customizable keyboards which makes the overall experience more fitting to individual typing styles, finger sizes, etc.Better integration with facebook and google accounts...all mail, calendar events, and contacts in one place and synced wirelessly to your phone and updated with facebook pictures and statusReal file management.  Allows you to cut, copy, move, delete files as you would on your computer.  Very important for working on the go or just to manage your files.  This combines great with apps like dropbox where you can sync all of your files together between computers and mobile devices...Very easy to unlock features such as wireless tethering...normally a $30/m feature, but easy enough to unlock on an Android device.  POSSIBLE to unlock a similar feature on iPhone, but with bluetooth tethering vs wifi.  Also doing so on an iPhone is much more difficult and dangerous since iphone is built to be unlockable in every way, whereas android is built to be easily unlockable and customizable.Open-source operating system:  This is where the fun begins and allows users to do all sorts of jazz like overclock, install custom operating systems, etc.  Of course, MOST won't bother with this, but the open source is what drives innovation and features from concept to reality.  This is why the gap between features on Android OS and iOS is growing exponentially.I am surprised that Apple's OS lacks the features that Android OS has, because Apple's Macintosh OS is known for having the most features and customization of any other OS, however, their OS on their mobile devices have by far the fewest and blandest features of the competition's OS on the mobile platform.Nonetheless, the Android OS, and thus the Samsung Galaxy Tab, is packed with much more customization options and features than the iPad and was the clear choice for me.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "better than ipad", "Author": "marcos cervantes", "ReviewID": "R1VUOB92B6YCDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have both an ipad and the galaxy.

Truong \"El Duke\"", "ReviewID": "RXP5T37T4M49K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my T-mobile Galaxy Tab for a few months now and have had enough time to gauge how it compares to other tablets available now. Although the 7\" Galaxy tab (the original, not the new 10\" ones that just came out) was one of the very first mainstream tablets that came out, it is still surprisingly one of the best tablets out there... definitely considering it's price range.  It is not obsolete and for those who do not need the latest, cutting edge tablet on the market, it should be more than sufficient for your needs. Some things that make this tablet great (that you may not realize) is how sturdy it is built. It's screen is made of \"gorilla glass\" which is glass that is specially tempered to make it virtually unbreakable. The body (chasis) feels really well built and sturdy too.  Another thing that sets it apart is the gorgeous screen. The screen is pretty high resolution for it's size, has great contrast ratio which makes the colors pop, has great color reproduction (can display a huge gamut of colors), and is vibrant and very bright.  I hardly have the brightness setting at the highest setting because it is too bright! In fact, it looks bright at half the brightness setting. Other things that make it a great tablet is the ability to use it as a wifi only tablet (no cellphone company service needed), micro-Sd expansion slot, great capacitive touch screen, swype keyboard functions, and blue-tooth functions. The advertised battery life of up to 7-hours is actually a reality too. It can actually be much longer if you primarily use it as a web-browser too.The 1ghz processor is actually pretty darn fast.  I know there are dual-core tablets out there now, but the 1ghz processor on this thing can handle most anything. Unless you are using a very detailed 3D intensive app, the processor doesn't show any signs of slowdown. I haven't really run into an App or game that it struggles to run. It runs the 3d racing game Asphalt just fine and HD video runs very smooth too. I would've liked there to be a HDMI video out port on it, but I'm not really sure how much I'd use it even if it was on it. All in all, I have very little bad to say about this tablet. It would be nice if Samsung made it easy to upgrade to the latest Android OS... I'm still running 2.2 which was pre-installed.NetFlix!!!:One of my complaints before was that it doesn't run \"Netflix\" but this is no longer a problem. You can indeed run \"Netflix\" on your Tab... and it doesn't even have to be \"Rooted\".  Just google for the andriod program/setup file called \"com.netflix.mediaclient-1.apk\", download it to your computer and move it somewhere onto your Galaxy Tab. Then using any free file explorer program (available from android market) you just select the file and install on your Galaxy Tab (from your Tab).Here are some quick Pros and Cons for reference:Pros:-Very well built and sturdy (including screen made from \"Gorilla Glass\"-Bright and Vibrant Screen. Looks as good as the screen on the iPad 1 in my opinion.-Nice portable size and very light-expandable micro-sd slot. Very easy to move files to and from the Tab... copy and paste from computer using windows!-1Ghz processor works great for most of your needs... I haven't had a 3D game it couldn't run yet.-Video runs really well, even HD files.  It plays Divx native so just drag and drop on to the tab and it plays it!-Up to 7 hours of battery life as advertised! Very nice when you're stuck on a long flight and wanna watch more than one movie!-You can use it as a wifi only tablet, no need to get service through T-Mobile.. or Verizon for that matter (see notes below)-Nice Mp3 player interface. I like the default pictures it uses when you don't have cover art.-Capacitive touch screen works great, and Swype keyboard works awesome too!-Built-in Blu-tooth, GPS, and Wifi! I had a Blu-tooth keyboard at one time and it worked great on the Tab.-Runs Netflix Now! See section on Netflix (above) if you missed it!Cons:-No HDMI port. This would be nice but ultimately I don't think most people would even use it.-No dual-core processor. This would be nice for very 3D graphic intensive games and better multi-tasking, but not really a must-have.Conclusion:As you can see, the positives greatly exceed the negatives. This tablet was designed, conceived, and built well. That's why it is still a great tablet even when compared to the new tablets out on the market now which have dual-core processors and HDMI output ports. I noticed that the new 10\" Galaxy Tabs no longer have an micro-SD expansion port like these 7\" Tabs do. Keep all of this in mind before you buy a Tablet.  In my opinion, this tablet is the best bang for the buck without sacrificing quality, reliability and sturdiness. If you are looking for a high quality and relatively affordable, Non-Apple tablet, look no further... this is it.Notes:If you have a T-mobile Tab, you can always use it as wifi only without getting service. For those of you who have a Verizon Galaxy Tab. When you reset the Verizon Galaxy Tab, it will prompt you to \"Activate\" it with Verizon before you can use it. I'm sure there are those of you who want to use it as a \"Wifi only\" Tablet without having to spend money to \"activate\" it.  There is a trick you can use to by-pass the activation process and not have to go through Verizon. It's very simple... here it is:Turn the Tablet on, On the Volume rocker on the right side... hit up ONCE, down TWICE, up THREE times, and lastly down FOUR times. It will then ask if you want to bypass activation. After the process, you should be able to use it as a wifi only tablet. You can always add service with Verizon later! I didn't come up with this trick, I am merely sharing it with you here!I hope this review is helpful... if it is, any feedback is welcome.

I am a novice and have not tried all of the sophisticated operations on it but I have the European unlocked 7\" tab and I love it.  I shopped for months and returned several devices before I purchased this one at Amazon.com.  It is exactly as advertised.  I especially wanted the voice phone capability.  I am amused at the  savvy YOUNG techies who are shocked that their domestic tab has no phone capability.  I learned early on that the PHONE COMPANIES disabled the phone cability on the US versions.  By the way I am 78-1/2 years old. I purchased a European version with warranty in order to have a phone.  All that was necessary to activate the phone was to transfer my old sim card from my old contract flip phone to the sim slot on the tab and I was up and running. Because I am old and a novice I went to the t-mobile store and the young clerk there did that for me.  I am now prepaid so I added $100 which gave me 1000 minutes with t-mobile which includes text messages but no data.  It also has an expansion sd slot which I have not used yet.  I have used the camera and it is fabulous.  It has wi-fi capability and I can purchase data access from t-mobile at a daily rate of $1.49 for any day I find myself without a hot spot. So far this has not been necessary.  I have free mobile wi-fi access from my home computer internet provider's hotspots (AT&T;) and those that appear to be available for free at many locations around town including airports.  I have a data transfer cable which I have used to transfer photos from my computer to my tab.  I am old so I don't recall now whether I purchased that separately or it came with the tab.  I also purchased a blue tooth head set, otherwise my phone is automatically a speaker phone.  I also purchased a bluetooth keyboard cover which has nice large keys. These devices all work perfectly with my tab. I have purchased a lot of accessories such as a gorrilla screen protector and car charger.  In summary this tablet is perfect.  I have not found any downside yet and I have downloaded many apps such as banking, e-reader and others and they work just fine.  I don't play a lot of games so I don't know how it will perform with all of the latest games.  The screen resolution is awesome.  It fits in my purse. I can't say enough.  Samsung and Google (mother of Android) Thank you!!UPDATE - I am now 80 yrs old and still having a romance with my same Galaxy tab.  I have switched to a T-Mobile data plan so I dont have to rely on wifi. Hot spots are not everywhere. For $50 bucks a month I now have unlimited  voice, text and data on my phone.  I use the camera often and it is awesome.  I have had no service issues since I bought the tab. I still use the Kindle app to read books flawlessly.  I added an additional sd card to expand my storage. I exchange photos with the kids, grand kids and others all the time. I have also added more apps which all perform well.  I am still a rabid fan of this device.

I've had it for well over a month now, and am still very happy with it.  First, I don't use HDMI so the lack of a port is not an issue for me, and since I don't tether it to my computer I don't mind the cables either. Blue tooth works very well on the Tmobile version.The form factor is very comfortable and the size is great in my hands.  It's easy to put in a pocket or in a purse.  The buttons work very well, and do light up when you tap the screen.  Web over WiFi is very fast, and is a joy to use.  Video playback is of good quality, and the tablet does record decent videos as well.  Multi touch is very precise, and I use both pinch to zoom and double tap which are both responsive.I do have Skyfire web browser installed, and that gives me the ability to have the Tab recognized by websites as a pc - which works well for sites like Amazon and eBay. I also have Docs installed, and can view and edit any word or excel document with ease.  Paired with the Apple wireless keyboard, I can do anything on the tablet that I could do on my laptop. I do not have it paired with a wireless mouse, since I don't see the point. The touchscreen on the tablet works well enough while typing.  I have paired it with a blue tooth headset and have made Skype calls with the tablet as well.

The main reasons I didn't get an ipad are the size of the product and the inability to run flash applications on the internet.

The main reason I do not give it 5 stars is because of it's weight. The device itself is not 'heavy' per say, but one of the main functions I was interested in, was being able to use it as an e-reader with the Kindle application for Android. While it has the app and it works well, the tablet does get a bit heavy if you are sitting and holding it to read. I have solved the issue when I am at my desk by getting a 'Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for Apple iPad, Galaxy Tab, BlackBerry Play Book' for it.. and a case.. but it is still a bit heavy to actually hold while reading.. sitting in bed as an example. .I know this is version 1.1 so to speak and it will only get better.

Manufactures want a part of the Apple iPad market and I as a consumer want to know how some of these new tablets compare.My trip last week to attend the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas was a whirlwind of activity.  There were back to back press conferences and press parties to attend.  There was also lots of waiting in lines and time spent on shuttle buses.  And that time was put to good use with the Verizon Wireless Samsung Galaxy Tablet.My new best friend...Verizon Wireless loaned me a Samsung Galaxy Tablet to take to CES and I was constantly using it during my entire trip. With its 7 inch screen, the Android OS Galaxy Tab is the perfect size to keep in my purse.  It only weighs 13.5 ounces. For my 4 hour plane ride from Detroit to Las Vegas, I loaded the Galaxy Tab with movies and Kindle books so that I would have lots to do on the plane.  I also popped the SD card from my smartphone into the Galaxy Tab so that I could use it to listen to music.Now my eyesight is not what it used to be so viewing movies and books on the Galaxy Tablet instead of my smartphone was a real pleasure.  Like the Apple iPad, the Galaxy Tab needs a stand to make it a good movie viewer. Manufacturers have already started producing fashionable cases for the Galaxy Tab (lots were at CES like this one from Case-Mate) and some of the cases have built-in stands.The Galaxy Tab's beautiful, clear screen is perfect for reading ebooks. But like the Apple iPad, you should not attempt to hold the Galaxy Tab like a book because it weighs too much to hold it for long periods of time. Your back and neck will not thank you for it if you do. It should be laid flat for reading or a stand should be used.The Galaxy Tab fit perfectly in my purse and I was constantly pulling it out to check email, Twitter and Facebook. I also used it to look up lots of information about manufacturers and products at CES.  It's 7\" size is its strength over the Apple iPad. It is very easy to carry around. When I walked through the press room at CES, I noticed that some of the reporters were also using Galaxy Tabs.Battery Life is so soI was a little disappointed at the Samsung Galaxy Tab battery life. After surfing the web in the airport, watching a movie on the plane going to Vegas and reading a Kindle book, the battery was near its end. I was hoping that the Galaxy Tab would have made it through the entire day without needing a charge. On other days where I did not watch a movie, the battery was only half used at the end of the day.3G Hot Spot is a real winnerOne of the major strengths of the Samsung Galaxy Tab is that it can be used as a 3G Hot Spot.  The hotel were I was staying did not have free wifi - and I did not care because I had the Galaxy Tab.  The Galaxy Tab can be used to provide wifi for up to 5 devices so I was able to work on my laptop without issue.The Samsung Galaxy Tablet also has front and rear facing cameras and it can record video. It has 2GB of internal memory and a 16GB microSD card pre-installed.  It also has a flash.The Battle of the Tablets...For those who want to know if the Galaxy Tab is the \"Apple iPad Killer\", I would have to say the two are not totally comparable. The Apple iPad has positioned itself to be a entertainment center with the extensive amount of apps that have been developed just for it. After many years on the market, the Apple iPad will not be dethroned as the king of the tablet. But the Samsung Galaxy has features that set it apart from the iPad and make it a wonderful tablet for everyday use. It is really easy to carry it around and use it for email and web surfing.What the Samsung Galaxy Tablet needs is its own exclusive set of Android applications developed especially to take advantage of its super sharp 7\" screen and functions. The apps that are available currently in the Android market place were not developed specifically for the Galaxy Tab. Some apps like the \"Twitter for Android\" are not designed to take advantage of the bigger Galaxy Tab screen. It will be interesting to see over the next year what kind of applications will be developed for the Galaxy Tab because those apps will help determine the future of the Samsung Galaxy Tablet in the \"Battle of the Tablets\".The Samsung Galaxy Tablet retails for $500 through Verizon Wireless with month to month service.As I pack up the Samsung Galaxy Tablet to return it to Verizon, I have to say that I will miss it.

The size is great, it's not too heavy to handle and it can easily fit into your purse or pocket.  Many times, it's not convenient to tote around a laptop so having the Galaxy Tab gives me quicker access to the internet no matter where I am; it is easy to use and navigate, and the loaded apps are very accessible.  I love the personal radio app.  The music is clear and it continues to play music in your chosen genre until you stop it.  The battery life is excellent!  I'm glad to know that I don't have to tote the charger every time I leave the house.  The camera is clearer than the one on my Blackberry phone.  Another reason I bought the Galaxy Tab is because it comes with a GPS and Kindle already loaded which took the necessity of buying 3 gadgets down to 1.  It is easy to use email and the keyboard is easy to navigate with one hand.  I absolutely love the Galaxy Tablet and would recommend it highly.  It is also easier than a laptop to use when traveling... it is not cumbersome and you don't have to look for an outlet.  Watching t.v., movies, or listening to music is SO much easier with the Tab when you're on the go.I bought a leather protective case which has a stand alone feature so you can use the Galaxy Tab and free your hands at the same time.  LOVE IT!!!  The leather cover does not make it bulky and it has appropriate holes so you're able to get to whatever you need without taking the Tablet out of the case.  I also bought protective film covers to protect the screen.  These two items are optional but I believe they are very essential if you want your Galaxy Tab to have a long life.

For all of those who were patiently waiting for an iPad-like device that runs Froyo 2.2, this is a winner. I have it on my home WiFi network and the internet download speeds are fast. My Droid Incredible will download the same pages slightly faster, but the difference is neglible. The stock browser is fine. It does not center the text nicley like Incredible does when I pinch in and out. Otherwise, it works well and is nicely laid out.All the Apps so far run fine and look great. I put Advanced Task Killer on the tablet. Interestingly, when I activate the Task Killer, very few apps get killed (single digits). With the (non-rooted) Incredible usually 30-40+ apps get the axe. I would surmise that Samsung put far less Bloatware on the this device than I have seen with other Droids.I read the review on Gizmodo before buying the device. Not sure what was going on with the Gizmodo reviewer. There are several possibilities: 1. They were having a psychotic break. 2. They are an employee of Apple. 3. They are new to Android and not the sharpest tool in the shed. The only thing that was correct in the review was the power supply is a bit unusual.I have an Apple iPhone (that I just replaced with my Droid phone secondary to poor reception), an iTouch, iPods and a Mac Book.

The giver of this gift purchased it at Costco.  I immediately started buying accessories for it but more on that later on.  On February 1 I received an email from my cell carrier T-Mobile with an offer for a Samsung Galaxy Tab for $250 (after $50 rebate) but you had to sign up for a $39.99 per month data plan.  I was on month to month with Verizon for the one I received at Christmas.  I spoke to the giver of the gift and he returned the Verizon one to Costco and got the one at T-Mobile.  This put $250 back in his pocket and I got an unlimited data plan with unlimited texting for $20 a month less than Verizon.Now, I love this thing,  I also have an Android phone but this is amazing,  The size is perfect for me to use without my reading glasses and yet unlike the IPad will fit in the pocket of my cargo shorts.  It is quick to load even complex pages when browsing and has a decent camera.  The interface is easy to use, even my 80-year-old neighbor found it simple and fun to use.I have the Samsung Car Mount.  When you put it in the bracket and connect the power cord to the lighter socket it switches to \"Car Mode\" which cancels the display timer.  You can use the camera to video your drive that is cool but the perk is the built-in and free Google Navigation with voice directions, and voice input.  Just tell it where you want to go and it takes your there.  The 7-inch screen is large enough to see unlike some other aftermarket nav systems.I also have the home dock with HDMI output and connect this directly to my entertainment system so I can play internet radio (Pandora) through my home system without any special equipment.I have seen some reviews about this freezing up.  I have not had that experience even when playing the internet radio in the car while using the nav system.Another great thing about the tab is its ability to tether to another computer or to become an internet wireless hot spot (Access Point).  You really need to connect it to a power source like the car or an ac adapter, as the amount of juice necessary to power the Access Point is significant.  I have used this feature when traveling.  It permits someone else in the car to use his or her laptop on the internet.  The internet speed is very good even when using the nav system at the same time.This is a very handy piece of equipment.  I recommend it without hesitation or reservation.One last thing, the $39.99 plan at T-Mobile is hands-down the best value in data plans so you will be able to take advantage of all the great things available on the internet without trying to find a hot spot.UPDATE After 16 months of heavy daily use two issues have come to light.  The first is the tablet now resets itself to the original setup erasing all the programs and the batteries no longer hold a charge.  I wisely purchased a Square Trade Service plan and have sent it in for service.  I will update after I get it back.UPDATE 2I received the tablet back from the repair center and they were unable to repair the tablet so they replaced the inside with a new system which is incompatible with my carrier T-Mobile.  The bright side of this is that I bought the Square Trade Warranty for this item and Square Trade is giving me $600 to purchase a newer model that will compatible with my carrier.

This is better than the HD tvs because you get the high resolution in a 7\" screen instead of the >46\" screen.The other selling factor is the smaller screen size than the iPad. I also tried out the iPad from a different friend and 10\" screen is quite large to be carrying around with you. The Tab's 7\" screen keeps the device small enough that it can be carried with you wherever you go. I would say that the portability is similar to the kindle but it is a little thicker.The only problem that I had with the Tab is the touch sensitive button at the bottom.

Answer to all that is best left to the debaters.When Apple announced its next genre-defying device, and we could all bask in the awesomeness of the few leaked images of the tablet of reckoning, I was torn. I asked myself in a few moments of so-called redneck-ism,  \"What the hell is that? Is it a phone? Can you even carry it in your pocket? Where the hell is the keyboard to that notebook?\" Little did I know that styli had been done away with completely from a type of computer I never knew existed, and the tablet computers were making their triumphant return (debut) in the already cluttered market of electronics. Thanks, Jobs, just what I needed, another must-have i-Thingy.Much as Apple has impressed me with its myriad trend-setting consumer products, this time the skeptic in me rang a pre-show alarm-bell. This was just ridiculous. The advantages of buying an i-Pad were far too few and in-between to trump the many disadvantages. That is the one thing you don't want in an electronic product. Huge screen size? No phone? No Android? No Google? What about 3G? No? You know, you can make HD trailers of people getting impressed with their new economic conquest all you want, buddy... I ain't buying. Bite it, Apple.A genre, once created, can only justify its name when it has more than one members. Monopoly is just a dream. The only question was who was going to come with a tablet worthy of standing up to the huge American coup. Europeans are just sleeping. (What's going on, Nokia? I believed in you!)And then the Koreans did it.When I first came to know about the Galaxy Tab, I was disheartened by people predicting its failure, firstly due to its lower size and similar cost to iPad, and secondly due to people calling it an overgrown smart-phone. Look guys, you can hate all you want, but I need to have a choice of screen-size when you force me to carry the damn thing by hand! 7 inches does not cause trouble in browsing, and easy to carry around! Like a little diary, even! Yay!Android phones are the best gadgets around. With the huge amount of apps flying around, you can use your phone to do about anything.(Many phones claim to do that. Anything. Android phones can actually do anything.) But in my opinion, the screen size of the Tab brings in a huge change in perspective by which to look at the apps. I didn't know what I hated about the apps in small smart-phones until I got my Tab. Believe me, Tab wins.The SIM card functionality is where Tab can really justify its rightful place as a competitor to the big-Huge Apple. WiFi as the only option for Internet? Phwah! I intend to turn my Tab into a GPS attached to my car (you can do that), and \"WiFi, won't you stay with me, just a little longer?\" cannot bend the will of almighty signals. I use my phone's 2G or 3G functionality to access internet everywhere! (Americans. People exist who cannot afford WiFi. It's not about money. It's about availaibility.)Camera! The quintessential smart-phone's got one. Why not i-Pad? Too much of a good thing, eh? Samsung's got two - one for video calls and another for, you know, camera purposes. Technical jargon alert - Tab has twice the RAM of an iPad, and 32 GB extendable. IPad is limited to internal memory. Multitasking can Tab but not iPad.Apple's hatred for third-party apps or software or firmware is legendary, and restricts its product usage to people who have grown up with Apple. C'mon Apple, by now you are like the rich kid in the sandbox who will let friends look at his cool new toys, but won't let you play as you want with then. This technological fascism must stop! If on the other hand, you work with a larger crowd, Tab is for you. I would recommend Tab over the iPad any day, and this I will also say, if by now, you still religiously buy all of Apple's new products, you either work for Jobs, or you are just trying to impress somebody.

Note my comments relate to the SIM free UK version (I think same as here but uncrippled).The size is very handy (iPad is bulky in bed), the screen clarity and colours are excellent (generally ok outdoors), the scrolling very smooth and touch responsive (-I expected slower than Nexus One phone [little sister] but was wrong; faster!), the battery life seems fine (1-2 days with average use on Wifi+some calls), the loudspeaker nicely loud and clear, the phone call quality excellent (NOTE: I bought the Amazon UK version with call enabled which I really reccommend). I do not use Bluetooth headsets.In particular, Android 2.2 OS runs smoothly on this, somewhat to my surprise. My experience is significantly better on this than my Nexus One phone (which I like). The Wifi connectivity is fine also and I am impressed with the call quality: I have conference calls with the Tab on the table and everyone hears me fine in Asia.I wish the battery could be swappable. Samsung have overpriced this alas (but produced a super device, my first Samsung device). Compared to the real headaches of deciding which carrier version to buy in the USA (and deactivation methods), I prefer to pay $700 in the UK and buy a straightforward SIM free no hassel device that works as it should. Samsung should have marketed it far more straightforwardly with carriers, to make it easier for purchasers to know what they are getting. For foreign buyers like me, it takes a month of Sundays to determine what the US versions mean. I still do not know the [hidden] costs of deactivating call / data plans in the US Tabs and 99% of salespersons don't know/tell reliably either and I talked to a few. I wish Android Marketplace would be available to foreign users - the free stuff is plentiful and ample but we can't buy what we want! Programs like Skype are also not available to us via Marketplace (and what is available at time of writing is chat only Beta versions, frustratingly unless you are on Sprint or some such US carrier).In price respects, Apple's Wifi pricing strategy is much better, though the iPad can't do many things this can (no multitasking, no camera, no phone?). The Tab's camera/s are quite good but could be improved for low light video/photo : normal outdoor use is fine as are videos and sound. Not enough suitable cases are available for the Tab.I do recommend the Tab with a call facility - not to hold as in a conventional phone but the functional quality is so good that you want to use it!I look forward to what Android 2.3 offers but although a heavy device user, frankly I am more than satisfied with my professional/personal needs with this.Overall I am very happy after deliberations on buying an iPad though I would be happier if it was cheaper!

I  fell in love.Then it started to hiccup and require apps to be force closed. And then it started to outright choke. Long strings of strange error messages that did not sound minor. I got a little tired of restarting it and waiting for it to boot up (this is not a quick process.)Then there's battery life. If you use it for an hour or two, you are going to get a low battery warning. This doesn't seem like long enough for a tablet to me. Okay, I'll plug it in and use it that way ...Then the scare when it wouldn't go on. Turns out it's just out of battery, but it acts dead. We got past that together.Finally one night it simply refused to boot. Just that logo glowing in the dark. Forever.I'd had it for four months.Samsung said it needed repair and sent me a mailing label. I sadly shipped it off. A week later, they said they got it. And week after that, they said it was on hold for a part.It's been a month now and no one can give me any idea when they might be sending it back. It's as if there is no concern at all about how long it takes to fix it. They got nothing but time at the service center ... la la la. Call back, they suggest. Again.The new Samsung tablet, 7.0 plus, is wifi only and costs twice as much as this one.

Will probably force it out of a Honeycomb Upgrade.I can not get Adobe Flash to install, but so far I haven't found that to be an issue on the web.Viewing Angels not a problem, Battery life - We'll see after it's conditioned but so far I'd estimate 4-8hrs depending on activities.Tested Transformers 720p HD and not one flickerSound from it's little speakers Impressive!Dropped my T-Mobile SIM in and BOOM instant Big Phone :D  The Speed only shows Edge, but I'm in a funky location.Phone quality - Just got off a 1 hour conference call using both the speakerphone option and the plugin headset.  No complaints from anyone. I heard the other end just fine.Reception signal is actually BETTER with this than with my actual T-Mobile HD2 phone.Highly Recommend getting a MicroUSB card as the internal memory is minimal.  Get the more expensive FAST card for better performance.Streaming music, sounds Great just as nice as an MP3.GPS works like a champ!Angry birds works great  :DMy only other Gripe is the keyboard - It functions fine, but I'd like to use the Market's Better Keyboard, which after installed and enabled - doesn't swap out for the swype keyboard that is standard.I may look into the \"rooting\" options that people have done with it's big brother, but so far it's handsomely accomplished everything I've tasked it with!If you're looking for a Bigger Screen Smartphone, and don't want to pay that extra Data Fee that the carriers are forcing on us, this is CURRENTLY your best option! and with that extra Data Fee you can't use it's competitors (Galaxy Tab for example) as a phone, even though they have the capability.If I have luck with rooting and installing any custom ROM, I'll post my results.  It's not a top priority ATM as it's satisfactory as it is.TO Viewsonic - Get is certified for Flash, and unlock it so I can use whatever virtual keyboard I want and you'd get 5 stars!!Update: 5/30 OK after using it awhile I've come up with two major flaws - this may be MY actual device, or an actual design flaw -  1) Charging has become a game - I have to Cinch the Power cord behind the Tablet using something to Hold it in place back there then maneuver the USB plug just right or it won't charge.  2)the \"Buzzer\" now goes off if you hold the the Tablet too tight or if its in my computer bag; and won't stop until you slap it.  So it now sits in a cradle, it functions fine and I still use it, but not outside of my home office.... I should have returned/exchanged it, but I had such problems getting basic information from Viewsonics' Customer Service, I just re purposed it and got the XOOM which I LOVE 110%.

I just got back last week from Mexico and used my Vpad7 as both a Phone and Internet Device.  Picked up a TelCel SIM Card and it was up and running.  Traveled from Merida down to Cuidad del Carmen and had 3G signal most of the way.  Mostly did texting in Mexico and back to the USA without any problems.  Checked my Yahoo Email Account without issues.  Reserved a hotel room in Campeche using KAYAK.com without issues.  Updated FB with pictures and comments on the fly.  I use it at home reqularly on the Home WiFi and where Free WiFi is available.There were a couple of issues with Android trying to type and it would start adding characters on it's own so some texting got to be annoying.  I haven't been able to link up with my T-Mobile Blackberry via BT using PDAnet and I've only got PDAnet working via BT when I had a Moto Cliq one time.  I've been hit and miss on some Movies I've setup using FabDVD where some run and others don't.  I think it's FabDVD cuz I tested the same files on an Acer A500 with Honeycomb and had some issues there as well.Overall, still glad I made the purchase even with the annoyances.  Currently watching for the US release of Acer A101 which is another 7-inch Tablet with 3G but has Honeycomb. I'll still keep and use Vpad7, especially since I want to test its Wi-Fi Sharing abilities the next time I'm out of the US.  If you want a 7-inch Tablet with lots of Marketplace Apps then get this tablet...I checked out the Acer A500 and there are very few Apps available for Honeycomb right now.Overview: I place the Viewpad7 above the iPad for the simple reason that it has these features...is more portable, has dual cameras, has MicroSDHC port and a SIM Port.  The Samsung Tab shows up on paper with a higher resolution, but I would have expected the Tab to have an AMOLED screen for that price.  The 1GHz processor on the Tab is definitely nice, but not a deal-breaker.  I do have a problem with Samsung hobbling it's phone features for the premium price, even if it is subsidized by the Carrier.  Samsung Tab, Viewpad7 and iPad are the only real choices if you want more features than an eBook Reader can provide.External: I definitely like the portability of the Viewpad7 which fits in your jeans back pocket even if in the Leatherette Case.  The Case could use an SD Card, Credit Card and SIM Card pocket...but that's a personal preference.  The fit and finish are clean but they should have placed the Mini-USB/Charge Port and Headset Port on the side so that you could connect to them even when the unit is sitting on the Case in Easel Mode.  The speakers are pretty loud and you'll get people looking your way if you're playing 'Video Poker - Jacks or Better'.  Easy access at the top of the unit to the MicroSDHC and SIM ports are a real plus.  Sure would be nice if this thing had an additional full-size/full-service USB2.0 port given the thickness.Wireless Functionality: Popped in a T-Mobile SIM with 3G Internet and was able to make calls with no problems.  You can use it as a Hub for making Conference Calls and a BT Headset works well.  I was only able to get EDGE Internet, which was extremely slow.  I could load up the WSJ website to read articles, but anything that used even a mildly graphics laden website just wasn't going to happen.  A little research and I found that T-Mobile uses UMTS1700(upload) and UMTS2100(download) for 3G and this unit only has UMTS850/1900/2100.  90% of the world runs 3G Internet on UMTS2100 where it's available.  The phone is World GSM ready with 850/900/1800/1900, but I won't get to test this out until mid-year from Mexico and hopefully Thailand after that.  As far as 3G, it should work in Mexico with TelCel as long as they aren't using the mini-SIM.  If you have a reliable Wi-Fi signal, the internet pops along pretty well.  I was able to run YouTube clips with no issues.  Flash 10.1 isn't available yet, but I hear it is in the works.  I tried hooking up a Palm Folding Keyboard and Interlink Mouse via Blue-tooth with no success...it doesn't play well with Pairing Codes that aren't fixed.Android OS 2.2 - This is where I think the unit needs more work.  Programs like Picture Gallery would 'Hang-Up' once in awhile and I'd have to hit the 'Return' to take a step back to get it going again.  Transferring pictures from my PC was kind of hit and miss with some having to be reloaded in order to be viewable.  The Gallery was nice when it worked properly, adjusting resolution of pictures automatically and allowing you to re-orient.  'Video Poker' would lock-up and I'd have to exit and restart.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get imported music and video to work.  The User Guide, which doesn't ship with the unit and is available from the Viewsonic Website, is pretty useless at best.  Transfers don't work as simple as 'drag-n-drop' like on my Android 2.2 phone.  This unit can be set up as a Wireless Hotspot, but since I haven't gotten to use 3G Internet it hasn't been tested real-time yet.Hardware - The Cameras are nice, but nothing to brag about.  A flash would have been nice and higher resolution always a plus.  They work.  The Internal 512MB is ROM, which means you'll have to add memory through the MicroSDHC port.  I wish it had at least 512MB Internal RAM so I could keep an on-board secure file for passwords and other sensitive info.  I haven't had the chance to run the battery down, but I've gotten 3hrs+ continuous use with some juice still showing on the Battery Indicator.  The Google Maps feature with GPS-Sats used as a navigator works well.  This should work fine with AT&T; 3G Internet and allow me to order pizza on the run and then navigate to pick it up.Docs-To-Go - Having this built in is very nice.  Word and .pdf Documents seem to work best.  I haven't been able to get a PowerPoint file to work yet and Excel works in basic mode, but still haven't been able to get it to function on a Workbook between sheets.Future - Still have to get imported vids and music to work.  Testing out on AT&T; 3G Internet and Wi-Fi Hotspot feature.  Root MagicJack so I can make International Calls back to the US.  I want to print wirelessly and it should be able to hook up to a Projector using a USB Printer Cable available on eBay and Amazon.Overall - This Tablet definitely has some issues still to be resolved and isn't as reliable as many Android Phones out there.  But it seems to be the best of what's available.  I'd still pick this over the Samsung Tab and if I had to go with the Tab I'd pick the AT&T; version so it would function Internationally.  I can see using this while waiting at the airport to board, or at the hotel to download my Electronic Boarding Pass before I leave.  I should be able to  hook up my laptop via the Hotspot feature in a pinch.  Fiddling is the only way to learn this Tablet since the User Guide is very limited.  The 7-inch format is definitely the way to go with lots of patience required.

My memory card comes in tomorrow and I've already installed like all the apps i want. im sure ill find more.Really really a great device, good for the price.Free SIM card is a great feature, especially for someone like me who is overseas a lot.If you don't want to pay too much, and don't want a data plan, BUY THIS TABLET.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Love My Viewpad! Perfect for me!", "Author": "Carrie Olguin \"KeriOkie\"", "ReviewID": "R1HAAR76BNW0BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Due to some of the reviews on this side I had reservations about buying this device. I needed an inexpensive all-in-one solution so when the proce dropped, I took a chance. I've had my Viewpad for a couple of weeks and I'm delighted.First of all, it's a hands free phone I bought as a replacement for my crappy pay-as-you-go T-Moble phone I bought a couple of years ago. I popped in the sim card from that phone to the vpad and made a call, no problems. The T-Mobile pay-per-use program is the least expensive option I've found for keeping an emergency cell phone with me. Problem was, I kept forgetting to charge to cell phone because I never use it. Well, I won't have a problem keeping the Vpad charged since it's so much more useful than a phone, both at home and when I'm out and about.I don't have 3G service, just edge. It's enough to grab an address from the Internet if I need directions. When at home, I have a wireless WAN for Internet access. The vpad jumped onto my home network without any problems. There is a setting to turn off data access for the phone so that I don't accidentally use my minutes for the Internet.If in the future I need better service or 3G access, AT&T; has some inexpensive pay-per-use options - $15 a month for data access on their Gophone 3G plan. They also have the \"Buy $100 minutes, won't expire for a year\" option as T-Moblie. I don't know if the unused portion rolls over like with T-Moble. The site doesn't say. But since I'm home most of the time, I can't see myself wasting the money. Most of the places I visit have free wi-fi, which is better anyway.For my car, I bought a  ToothPik Mobile Bluetooth Hands-free Car Kit that also plays music through my car speakers. The Vpad connected to the toothpick right away. For at home and when I'm shopping, I bought the Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset (both phone and music) the vpad connected without problems. I'll be looking for a bluetooth keyboard next. I'm hoping the case/keyboard combo for the Galaxy Tab will work. I've spent enough money this month, so I'm holding off.There's no Netflix app for this device, which is a Netflix issue not a vpad issue. I don't travel often and I have a 27\" widescreen monitor for watching movies at home, which is much better than a 7\" screen. Would be nice to have to entertain the kidlet when on the rare road trip. But he's taken over my ipod which does play Netflix via wi-fi. And he's happy with the screen size. Oh, to have young eyes again...I loaded videos to play on the vpad, which uses the same formatting as an ipod. Of course, I purchased an \"optional\" 32GB memory card, which really isn't an option. The user manual doesn't give instructions on how to do a data transfer from a computer. But the vpad comes with a USB cable to connect to a computer. When the device recognizes it is attached to a computer, it asks if you want to enable USB transfers then shows up as a device in My Computer. It's drag and drop from there (create your own folders). Just remember to close the connection before removing the device from the computer or you have to turn it off and back on again for the card to be recognized. Sometimes trial and error is the best way to learn.The device does not use Media Player or iTunes for sincing. For that, you are on your own. (USB connect, drag and drop)It is supposed to sinc to contacts in Outlook. I don't use Outlook, so I have no idea if that works. It did not work with Windows mail contacts so I had to type in my contact data. The T-Mobile crappy webservice-backup wiped out my contacts, way back when, and I never added the contacts back or I probably could have grabbed the data from the sim card.Documents to Go - one of the reasons why I purchased this device - allows me to view and EDIT MS Word files and has a decent pdf viewer made much easier due to the 7\" screen. Docs to Go for Word does not read rtf or txt files (just doc) kind of a bummer but I can deal. I'm a touch typest so I won't be using the onscreen keyboard for writing novels. But I can edit one and write notes and ideas while away from the house. ;-) I haven't used the Excel or Powerpoint Docs to Go and probably won't.The onscreen keyboard is okay as on screen keyboards go. Due to the larger screen, I don't make as many typing mistakes as I did on my ipod and I can type much faster. I don't use the Swype feature.As an ebook reader - another reason why I wanted this device - it is decent. The Kindle app loaded without any problems. Eyestrain after a few hourse was a problem until I changed to a black background with white text, which seemed to help. I usually use my laptop for reading ebooks when at home. The vpad is for when I'm away, waiting for the kidlet for whatever reasons.The vpad connects to the official Goggle app store where there are plenty of free and paid apps. So far, I only have free apps like Angry Birds (almost a requirement for smart phones), Spider Solitare, social networking apps and more ebook readers.The touch screen is more sensitive than the reviews here led me to believe. My ipod doesn't feel nearly as sensitive. BTW, with the vpad sometimes you touch and hold to activate hidden submenues (a feature not discussed in the user manual). I have to be more careful when scrolling in the vpad than I do on the ipod or I activate a feature I hadn't intended. That's more of a technique problem than a problem with the device. The more I use it, the fewer problems I have.I'm still getting used to the four \"buttons\" (hot spots on the bezel) on the side of the device for \"back\" \"Search\" \"main screen\" and \"Settings\" that light up for a few seconds when touched then go dark. I'm getting used to the location and find I'm not fumbling for the right one as often. Sometimes I grab the device the wrong way and activate one of the buttons. Happens less often the more I use the device.I can create music playlists on the fly and delete duplicate files. The Media Player playlists I downloaded from my computer are recognized as lists on the vpad but do not play correctly. Don't know what is up with that. I have 8GB of music to organize. Sigh...The case that comes with the device is perfect for me. The flap covers the screen when in my daypack and flips into easel for tabletop use. I don't like that the power and headphone jacks are on the bottom of the device. Kind of annoying when the juice is low and I can't use the case the way it was designed.I use facebook. No problems there. The notifications (set up to make a sound) show up at the top of the device. I pull down the tab and see who said what. Tap and the app launches so that I can comment.The same notifications show received text messages. Hubby and I are sending little love notes, something we never did when I had the crappy old cell phone. If I had know buying a vpad would add a bit of romance to my life, I would have purchased it a long time ago.So far, the battery life is the same as a cell phone. The more I use it, the faster the battery drains. The more options I have running in the background, the faster the battery drains. In the settings, there's options to turn off the background items like wi-fi, bluetooth, (and airplane mode) to help save battery. I don't charge this device as often as I do my ipod, which was almost every day.There is so much more to this device, many options I have yet to play with like the voice to text, cameras (still and video), GPS navagation, video chat and whatever other apps there are to discover. I'll know more as summer progresses and we go on a vacation.When Smart Phones become intelligent enough to get a job to pay for their high monthly service fees, I might consider getting one. I \"played\" with an iPad one time, which was enough to know I wouldn't be happy with the size vs features vs price issues. I can't afford the other 7\" tablets like The Tab, Zoom or Dell and I wanted an inexpensive cell phone replacement option, which the others do not provide. So even if the Vpad isn't perfect, for me, it is the perfect all-in-one solution.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works just fine BUT surf's not blazing!", "Author": "zeroISallORnothing", "ReviewID": "R169UZP7VP1LJ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read [and re-read] the reviews on this site for Viewpad7 and all others...finally got it on Feb 19, 2011,  because wanted [NOW] an android tab with SIM unlocked [Huawei S7 is the other one out there - but don't buy a poor battery, resistive screen android 2.1 brick for 299 and tax S7 Android Tablet (WiFi, 900/2100 3G, 7-inch Screen)]. There is no 'viewing angle' issue as someone has pointed out [of course some deterioration at acute angles lower than 30 degrees], the WiFI is super stable [on a b network] and the whole Android mktplace is there for you. Downloaded TIME mag, Weather.com, Yahoo Mail/Finance, youtube apps and am up and running.  While youtube works very well this DOES NOT have a flash enabled browser. Of course Dolphin/Skyfire etc. may help there. Wife is happy she gets her Facebook, Y!mail, Goog calendar updates,Picasa all neatly integrated on a well designed notification screen - tap, tap, tap and there she goes. Kids impressed with the youtube and Voice search feature. The capacitive screen is just fine and virtual keyboard comes with Swype and works well.  Password entry is good.  Do turn on 'predictive text' - you will find it very valuable.  Ordered a 16GB card with it, haven't got to use it yet, system says 110 MB still available. As noted by community the T-Mobile SIM works just like a charm and the phone design is great [checked out a conference call - b/n my cell, wife's cell and land line - Ha!] - BUT the voice comes out on a speakerphone, so public use is limited [unless using supplied earbuds].  Form factor is sleek and sturdy and the included case is well designed. As mentioned the power-in location could have been different, but no deal breaker.  The 600MHz CPU is my problem and web surfing is obviously slower compared to my 2.33GHz laptop, so apart from short bursts of info usage I won't persist with this for surfing...but a tab is not for writing code for 6 hrs at a stretch, one should not compare aggressively. Included Documents to Go handles MS Office well.  Hey it's a real GPS, MP3, 'laptop', cell phone, dual facing camera [no flash], organizer, barcode scanner {?}...if double the bucks don't bother you [for similar sounding competition] and you recognize that this is pretty much it - for an integrated tab/phone out there then go for it [don't know much about the 10 inch iPad, but from what i hear there is no camera, no SD card slot, no USB and no SIM slot]...it is not a bogus/outdated product [like some others on sale on this site - beware of bricks/paperweights] and is a nice home/office network appliance for easy info updating.

Here is the short version review up front:Pros:- Android 2.2 - While currently supplanted by 2.3 and 3.0, it was in immense upgrade for those of us who had been used to using 1.6.  There are a lot of tweaks that make this version fun and functional (thanks Laptop magazine!)- SIM slot - I bought it for use in Afghanistan, while deployed.  My only semi-reliable internet option was Afghan Wireless Cellular Company(AWCC).  While there was nothing better than Edge network speed available, sending an email or surfing the web at the drop of a hat from anywhere was a lifesaver.- Android Market - Even though I could not purchase paid apps while out of the US, just having access to the free apps(yes, there really are thousands) kept me from losing my sanity.Cons:- 3G - In the US, I used it with T-mobile, who does not operate their 3G network on a frequency compatible with the Viewpad7.  I assume that its meant for use with AT&T; or another company.- Case - The leather case that came with it started coming apart at the seams after a month or so.  Not the end of the world since I bought a neoprene case to better weatherproof it.  Still, the leather case was nice because it allowed the unit to be propped up at the optimal viewing angle.- Speakers - The volume of music played through the speakers, or a call on speakerphone, is ok for a quiet room, or even the inside of my truck with the radio off.  In a room with 2 or three other conversations going on, however, a bluetooth headset or the supplied wired headset is a must.  Since I didn't buy it to replace a boombox though, its still a great device.I pit it daily against a coworker's Ipad, and day in and day out this one is the winner.  The 7 inch size is clearly more portable and the GPS, Sim slot, phone, and Market are icing on the cake.  The only thing that would have been nice is more internal storage and RAM since it only takes a handful of apps running to bog it down.  But with judicious use of an app killer, I can play Angry Birds or edit an Excel spreadsheet with no issues.Currently, its primary use is as my mp3 player/workout timer/journal, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tip to get AT&T; Tablet Data Plans working on the ViewPad 7", "Author": "SoyUnSUD", "ReviewID": "R35N7MTG8I35T9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Short ReviewOverall I haven't decided if I am going to keep this tablet. There is nothing wrong with it but at the price point the Dell Streak 7 may be a better choice since I am looking to implement this into a business application that will be getting heavy usage.

I tried to copy the APN info off of a Samsung Galaxy in the AT&T; store that was working but it did not work for me on the Viewpad.The settings that worked for me are as follows (These settings are found in Settings-->Wireless & Networks-->Mobile Networks-->Access Point Names):***I think all settings are case sensitive***Name: AT&T;APN: broadbandProxy: <Not Set>Port: <Not Set>Username: <Not Set>Password: <Not Set>Server: <Not Set>MMSC: <Not Set>MMS proxy: <Not Set>MMS port: <Not Set>MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: NoneAPN type: <Not Set>**If this still doesn't work try setting the Network Mode to GSM Only and once it connects change it to GSM/WCDMA auto to get faster 3G speeds.Update:Device seems to be more stable than expected.

I had been looking for about a month and decided on this unit because of versatility.  The ability to plop in my phone SIM card (GMS) is a major plus.  Although my phone (Galaxy S) has 1Ghz, so presumably faster, I find no lag in the functionality of this tablet.  I am very impressed with battery life.  When I first got my phone, I freaked when it was out of juice in 12 hours (now lasts 2 days after 2.1 update).  This Viewsonic device is still going on a charge when I first got it Tuesday.  Unplugged at 3pm, heavy use that evening (youtube, etc.), moderate use the next, no use Thursday, and now it is Friday noon and the battery icon is half full!  Actual percentage after going into setup is 39%, but that is not bad.  This thing is essentially a big cell phone, which is fine because I love my Android cell phone.  I think that is how it got certified by Google so it could have Marketplace, where Viewsonic 10 inch (G) does not, or phone features (but it costs less too).  Also, a 7 inch tablet seems bigger than I would think too - plenty of real estate for browsing.  I get great viewing from all angles, so it is a good screen.  Plagued with same issue of all like devices, including laptops: shiny glass covering LCD creates tons of glare and refections.  I will get a screen protector that reduces that like I did for my phone.Con: One thing that prevented 5 stars.  Home page (desktop) does not want to rotate.  It stays in landscape mode.

Very solid, doesn't feel like you are going to break it like many tablets. No fear of 'going at it' with your fingers, hands, thumbs, etc. Power supply and accessories seem well made. Nothing shoddy. Case is obviously a mid-range item, but still nicely made. I think the way it clips into the case may be where some of the 'unresponsive buttons' complaints have come from. Clipped into the case you will occasionally find that the buttons close to the clip will have to be pressed more firmly - I think it is actually holding the device a little too firmly and causing some issues with the sensitivity. Out of the case it never fails, loosening that clip a bit and it now never fails in the case either.- Smooth as butter touchscreen. No lagging between touch and drag, pinch and zoom, etc. I do notice that the built in browser is a bit laggy on touch and drag if pages are laiden with graphics. None at all in Opera or Boat... Boat just rocks.  (perhaps trying to pinch and zoom before pages or maps are loaded? Absolutely no problems here)- Slow??? No way. 8 apps open. 2 3D games, bluetooth headset still connected, 2 browsers (Opera and Boat both set to Desktop), Gmail, Market, Task Killer, App2SD and Live Wallpaper all going simultaneously and it FINALLY started to show a TINY bit of lag switching between apps, but would STILL be smooth once you are inside of whatever app. Just friggin' awesome.- SIM phone/internet. Okay this is just the deal maker. I use AT&T; 'Brand X' - had to fix up the APN info a bit. Presto! Internet anywhere I go and wicked fast anywhere a tower supports it (most places).

Voice recognition is much better than I thought. 'Call Home' and it calls home. 'Call Escalation Center' - no problems.- Supplied case is very handy although I have a bluetooth keyboard/case on the way. Looking forward to trying that out.- Battery life is ridiculous (in a good way) for this size tablet with this much running.  (Bluetooth always on, regular phone and web use for talking to the boss / support and updating / closing cases throughout the day. I still have about 1/4 charge left. Just touching the orange zone. This has been about a 9 hour day so far. Granted that's not solid videos but seriously... my laptop had to be plugged in at least once in the day. This is nice.)- No flash support? No problem. I hope flash dies a painful death as soon as possible. If you really desire it then use Skyfire browser - it converts flash to HTML5 for you so no problem. I personally don't miss it for what I use it for and I can still enjoy all the YouTube I can eat.- For all of those who think Keyboards or Mice won't work - BLUEINPUT - download it, install it, pay the man his very well deserved 14 bucks or whatever. There is no device I've come acros it won't hook up to. Including this tablet. Now that I own one I can verify that two cheap china keyboard have already worked no problem.

It worked well, but it was larger than I'd wanted, and became a wrist-breaker after an hour or so.  Returned it.  Looked at 8- 9\" tabs, but they were still too large.  Wanted back pocket portable, Settled on the 7\" format, then did some looking and research.  I have a decent laptop, so I wasn't looking for another laptop, especially one without a cover.  A bit of history:  I still keep a Handspring Visor, although I haven't used it in 5 years. It had a \"palm\" based OS with touch display. It kept detailed contact data, e-mail, expense records, notes, Calendar events, text files, database and spread sheet files, and could synchronize all to and from my PC. It had early sD Cards for storage, and a bunch of plugins: unlocked phone, true GPS, camera, Mp3 player, touch display, modem, I forget what all. Loved the device, but it had too many parts, and  batteries, and was slow and small, and tended to lockup.  It's probably what I had in the back of my mind when I found the vpad7.  The Viewsonic vpad7 does all these things and more, (synchs via a mini usb cable.)  The deal-maker was the 3G phone plus WiFi. It's allowed me to select an economical voice/text/data cell phone plan, as I am a heavy user of text service, with some voice.  Occasionally I'll enable cellular networking, (something the android platform allows you to do,) when I'm without Wifi access, for e-mail file downloads.) I also carry a \"Clearwire\" Wifi plan, that has no limits, and apparently no throttling down of speed, for surfing & file up/downloads.  That it lacks Adobe Flash support is a non-issue. I am able to watch what I want on my laptop. Digital movie & video music files, u-tube all play on this unit, if not, the android Market probably has something which supports the file.  Bought a 16 Gig Micro SD Card, T-Mobil sim card, both worked without a hitch. Not trying to store a bunch of full length movie files on the unit, so storage is not an issue; but a 32 Gig microSD card is supported.  Volume for phone is a bit soft in noisy areas, so the supplied ear-buds are good, I bought a basic Bluetooh ear piece, use it for driving or walking around.  I've had a handful of notifications from Android Market about Updates, click on link, takes about a minute.  Basically it works a lot better than the stats and some of the comments indicate.  If it were dual core and 1 Ghz speedy, and had gamers quality video acceleration, I might buy it, but for what I use it for, I don't think I would notice the difference, and the boost in price wouldn't be worth it.  Can't believe there aren't more manufacturers making unlocked Phone tablets about this size.  Perhaps the cellphone companies discourage these units, as they want to control access to, and the price of, spectrum.  Display is bright, with excellent resolution.  The best part is all the functionality, and a cell phone, in one compact use-able package.  Been about a month, and it hasn't crashed, locked up, or fallen apart.  Comes with an awesome case, folds down in the middle-back to expose the rear camera lens.  Can't run these things over, or toss them out a window and expect them to work.  I once used a research Notebook sized PC that could be dropped 30 ft, and could float, but it cost my employer $3,000+ per unit!  My only issue was that the case was slightly abraded on one of the folding edges, as if it had been used, but I don't notice anymore. You need to be a bit tech-savy to negotiate some of the android system setup, but it's not Discrete Math or anything like that.

Because of the Vpad7, I rarely carry my netbook around anymore.  I bought the Vpad7 because it IS basically an oversized smart cellphone and I wanted a bigger screen than my Motorola Backflip, but also has 3G and all the capabilities of my cellphone.  I bought a 16gb class 10 microSDHC card to give the Vpad7 more memory...and that seems to also have increased the speed too...the Vpad7 is unlocked...I simply switched my ATT SIM card from the Backflip to the Vpad7 and it worked with no issues.Everything works as I expected, so I'm pleased.  Now, because of it's size, I can't just put the Vpad7 into my pants pocket and take off like I can with the Backflip, but I typically carry a backpack with me and the Vpad7 goes in there.  I also have a Plantronics Bluetooth and I do carry the Bluetooth earpiece in my shirtpocket (or on my ear) for receiving phone calls quickly. I've downloaded a few good free apps...and a couple of low priced apps...to make switching on the Wifi and hotspot capability easy and quick and to track my usage.  Like anything new, I had to get familiar with the Vpad7 and it's virtual keyboard...I don't recall ever looking at any instructions.  Installing the SIM card and MicroSDHC card was easy.  I was already an Android user with the Backflip.  If you're new to Android, that will add to your learning curve.The cons are that you need to buy a MicroSDHC card.  It's size is both a plus and drawback.  Maybe something an inch smaller would have made it easier to slide into a pants pocket...but I don't think you'd want to sit on it if it were in your jeans backpocket.  My main usage is accessing the internet throughout the day and I occaisionally make phone calls and do texting.  If you're heavy into lots of phone calls and texting as you walk through the mall, then this isn't going to replace your cellphone because you can't just put the Vpad7 into your pants pocket to get to it as quickly as you can the cellphone.  Also, it has a mini USB connection...so for $3 you may want to get a mini to usb adapter.  I don't have one yet, because that thought just occurred to me... :-)Best wishes to you.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tablet and phone for a great price.", "Author": "JPdOrleans", "ReviewID": "R164U8PPE4WR0N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a cheap introduction to tablet computing and I haven't been disappointed.

I appreciated that I could use it for data if needed, text AND Phone Calls all in one package.

I felt very comfortable knowing I had it with me. By the way, the phone works well as a speakerphone or with the built-in bluetooth; but the included stereo earphones isolated noise and my wife and I could share them to talk more privately with folks back home. (Yes, I cleaned the bud before offering it to her.)Battery life was absolutely fine and I never ran out, but I did NOT use it for movies or constant data downloads - only as needed - and I charged it every night.

It starts up quickly, the touch screen is extremely smooth and responsive. The 3mp camera is nothing special, but definitely not poor.

The viewpad 7 only comes with 512 mb of internal storage, over half of which is occupied by the operating system and the pre-installed apps that, as best I can tell, cannot be uninstalled, leaving only about 180mb for additional apps. From first turning them on, both myself and my brother (who also got one) had filled the internal storage to capacity and had to go back and uninstall several apps to make the tablet even function. Even if I move the app onto an external SD card, about half stays in internal memory, limiting me to about 10 apps at any given time, and even then the tablet will stop at random and force me to clear up space by deleting various app data and caches before I can continue using it. Operating the tablet with such little free space also seems to cause it to crash and restart randomly when using certain apps.In short, this is a great tablet for casual use, especially for movies, music, pictures,etc. and the unlocked phone and data features are a big plus, but if you plan to use many third party apps be warned that the memory shortage will cause you a LOT of headaches.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "viewpad 7 rebooting", "Author": "lonny r. waddle", "ReviewID": "R1ICRHF0GJU8D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Viewpad 7 repeat rebooting.NO help for Viewsonic.have emailed Viewsonic support with no response so far.Be aware of problem.

If you want an Android tablet you can root or upgrade, don't bother, you will not be happy. If you want it to be an Ipad, forget about it.However, if you want a $250 color e-reader that has a stable OS, long battery life, and a seven inch 800x600 touchscreen you will be pleased.

The screen size, the rubber back, touch screen, wifi, and all day battery life make this an excellent e-reader that compares well with the Nook color. The new version of the Android Kindle app (which can be downloaded from freewarelovers.com) also allows you to download magazines in color.As an e-reader with expanded capabilities the Cruz is a great product and I am very pleased with it. Out of the box, the software is very stable, the battery is 75% charged and the Kindle app is ready to go. As a cutting edge Galaxy or Ipad competitor, the Cruz falls short, but it is much cheaper than those devices. I describe the Cruz to my friends as a  Kindle version of the Nook Color. A \"Kindle Color\" is the best way to describe it.I have loaded my Cruz with the following apps, all obtained from freewarelovers.com or the web, and they all work well: Kindle, Overdrive Media Console (for library e-books), Kobo Reader, Aldiko Reader, Wapedia, Newspapers, Reuters, Iheartradio, Skyfire browser and Dolphin browser.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "EDITED: Not As Happy Now", "Author": "Kalaab M. Pickering", "ReviewID": "R16DI7XMBS05SA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "EDIT: After having this tablet for over a year now, I'm reducing the star rating from 4 to 2.  After buying and reviewing this tablet originally, I bought a Samsung Transform phone, which runs Android 2.2.2.  After having a direct comparison, this tablet started showing its flaws.  While I still stand by my original comments (which remain unedited below), there are some significant issues that I found unsatisfactory:* Software Limitations - This turned out to be a big one for me.  When I bought this tablet, I noted a wide variety of file support.  However, as time has passed, this device's fairly early Android O/S doesn't support a lot of newer apps.  Also, while finding .apk files to install software on the internet is easy, the complete lack of Android Market/Play Store support is a major disadvantage.  Also, you can't upgrade the Android O/S on the Cruz, possibly on account of my next point:* Hardware Limitations - I can't weigh this too heavily, simply because tablets are a one-shot device that can't really be upgraded (though I believe that day is coming soon).  In any case, The Cruz's 528mhz processor (compared to my Transform's 800mhz processor) definitely trails behind.  Both devices have 256mb of RAM, and the Transform's performance totally clobbers the Cruz.* Usability - Since my purchase of the Cruz, I have also purchased a low-rung Kindle.  I purchased the Kindle when the price dropped, and I won't read on another platform ever again.  I've had experience with the Nook readers (both color and virtual paper display models), and the elegance and functionality of the Kindle is far superior.  I was shocked at how pleasurable and simple the reading process is on the Kindle, as compared to the Cruz, which is clunky and slow.  The gripe I had with Kindle's more narrow format support is easily remedied with the free open-source software Calibre, which organizes your library and converts formats.  With the Kindle, pages turn faster, the text is easier on the eyes, and the reading process is far more transparent than on a tablet.  I find that to be the case with color readers in general, including the Kindle and Nook, but the Cruz makes it very obvious you're doing other things besides reading when you use it.I'm still fairly happy with it as a portable media device and a mess-around toy for internet browsing and such, but the execution of this device could have been a lot better.  I still recommend it, with the caveat that you understand what it can and can't do before purchasing it.  I still find uses for it.ORIGINAL REVIEWOriginally, I was going to title my review \"Excellent eBook Reader\", but that would be selling the Cruz Tablet short.  Although I primarily use my Cruz Tablet as an ebook reader, it is actually a multimedia device with internet capabilities.  This is a stark difference to conventional ebook readers, who usually tack on features like MP3 playability almost as an afterthought.  The Android operating system effectively and elegantly addresses six key features: ebooks, internet, music, movies, pictures, and games & apps.  I will break each down:eBook Reader: The Cruz was an obvious choice for me as an ebook reader for three reasons: PDF, TXT, and HTML support.  Of course, there are apps that allow you to read the major ebook formats as well (Kindle, Nook, etc), but given the abundance of ebooks that use the three standard formats mentioned above, the lack of support for these formats on any reader is, to me, unacceptable.  These formats have been around for many years and are excellent formats for ebooks.  When an ebook reader supports only its proprietary format and maybe one of those three, that sends a message to me that they're interested in the money of their constituency, not their ease of use or satisfaction.  In any case, the Cruz supports all major formats for ebooks, and reading on it is a pleasure.  (*****)Internet: The Cruz supports true internet connections, meaning 802.11x wireless connectivity.  The included browser is sufficient for most applications, but does not support Flash, meaning no youtube, etc.  A previous reviewer recommended the 3rd-party browser Skyfire, which I have installed successfully for that purpose.  Aside from that, there is not much else to comment on.  The web is at your fingertips, as the tired old saying goes. (****)Music: With the ability to read numerous formats and create playlists, it's a good fill-in for an MP3 player if you only want to carry one device.  Media of all types (ebooks, movies, music, etc) are stored on an SD card, which I find more convenient than limiting.  The size of the device does not behoove you to ditch your standard MP3 player, but considering all of the additional functionality of the device, it'll make you think long and hard about it. (****)Movies: This device reads MP4 format for video.  While I prefer other codecs and file formats for compressed video, you can get a reasonably good-looking and -sounding full-length movie down to just over a gig with the right software, making this a very enticing feature of the tablet. (***)Pictures: Photo support is pretty standard these days, and the implementation of photo galleries and desktop pictures is what you would expect.  Nothing about this feature stands out, but on the other hand, nothing is missing. (***)Games & Apps: A lot of people have griped about a lack of official Android Market access on this device, and while those complaints are valid and realistic, there is an abundance of software you can install on your Cruz from many resources.  There are third-party marketplace apps ready to be installed, and finding apk software bundles on the 'net is a cinch.  Installing is as easy as dropping the apk on your SD card, browsing to it using Android's Astro file browser, then launch and install.  I have run into a few applications that don't want to cooperate, but the vast majority of apps and games I have installed have been problem-free.  Keep in mind, however, it does take some know-how and creativity to find apk's without Android Market, but it is not difficult. (****)Overall, I'm compelled to give this tablet four stars overall.  The tablet takes a bit of getting used to, but is easy to use and makes taking media with you wherever you go a snap.  The fact that the tablet features a user-replaceable battery is also a perk, considering some manufacturers (who shall remain unnamed) like to stick it to you in that area.Naturally, this tablet will garner a lot of comparison to the iPad.  However, this notion is strictly apples-to-oranges in its nature of comparison, though I will say that I prefer the ability to choose and install software rather freely with the Cruz, an option not as immediately available to iPad users.I do not wish to make this a soapbox review about the evils of Apple equipment; I will be the first to admit that Apple makes good, sound, reliable, and accessible equipment.  However, for reasons stated above (as well as reasons not stated in the review pertaining to Apple), my purchase of the Cruz was not just a matter of settling, it was a matter of preference.I love this product.  After using it as much as I have (for all sorts of things), I just shake my head while I look at the Kindles and the Nooks with bemusement.  They seem to me like a dial watch: \"What, all it does is tell time?  Isn't this the 21st Century, the Information Age?\"  ... Okay, that may be taking it a bit far, but there is certainly a gap in functionality between these new tablet devices and ebook readers.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Love Mine But After A Few Easy and Legal Mods", "Author": "FrisbeePat", "ReviewID": "R3VCRTXRCF5DLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I love this device! And just so you know, I was a software engineer in my previous career and now teach an engineering curriculum in high school, so believe me, when kids are wowed by your technology then you know it's good stuff. A few months ago I foolishly bought a Chinese knock-off Android tablet and I hated it; it was the classic case of \"you get what you pay for.\" The Cruz T301 is definitely NOT a knock-off. The screen is gorgeous and extremely responsive, the Kindle app works just fine with all my eBooks, and there are plenty of the apps that I need in the Amazon store. Take note, I said \"apps that I need.\" No, the Cruz does not have access to the Android Marketplace but let's be honest, there's a lot of junk apps in the full marketplace and I don't need 99.999% of them.For those that are either having troubles with their Cruz or are hesitant due to some of the negative reviews, I should tell you that the Cruz is not great out of the box. There are some things you need to do in order to get the maximum performance out of it. None of these things will void the warranty (like rooting it) or take a great deal of expertise.1. Read the complete user guide BEFORE opening the box. The manual included with the Cruz is laughable at best.2. UPGRADE TO ANDROID 2.2! I am shouting that one because it is the first thing you should do with it out of the box! (After giving it a full charge anyway) The upgrade is easy to do, takes about no more than 15 minutes, and there are simple step-by-step instructions on the manufacturer's web site. Believe me you will see a great deal of improvement in performance if you upgrade it. Plus upgrading it to 2.2 is just the right thing to do. No one should be running 2.0.3. Download and install the SkyFire web browser. The browser is not available in either the Cruz Market or the Amazon Marketplace (as far as I can tell) so what I had to do is find the install file online, download it to my laptop, copy it to the Cruz's SD card, and then install it from there. This browser has workarounds for lack of Adobe Flash support and loads full web pages (instead of mobile versions of web sites) at acceptable speeds.4. Spend the $9.95 to upgrade to OfficeSuite Pro. I've had pretty good experiences with not only browsing MS Office documents (both old format and 2007) but editing and even composing them as well.5. Install a screen shield/protector. Not only will it reduce (if not eliminate) scratches on the surface, it reduces the glare and improves the touch response, especially when dragging items. Actually every tablet owner should do this, it just makes sense. If you don't want to do it yourself, find a Zagg store at a nearby mall and have them install one.6. Repeat to yourself: THIS IS NOT AN IPAD! You paid less than half the price of an iPad and you're getting almost all of the capability. If you want an iPad, save more money, wait a while longer and buy one. It only has 256 MB of RAM so don't go crazy opening 20 apps at once. Some apps will stay in system memory even after you close them out, so use ASTRO (the Cruz's file manager) to kill any unwanted apps to free memory.Again, I'm a techie so I think I have a sense of what's good and what's not. For the past year I've been Jones-ing for either a Kindle, and iPad, or both. Now I don't want either one because my Cruz has made me extremely happy, once I did the steps I listed above. And I hope I've persuaded those of you on the fence to go ahead and buy the Cruz 301, I think it's a steal at for the $160-$200 price range.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "As long as your expectations are in check, you'll love it", "Author": "TRLB", "ReviewID": "R18SIF1P5ONZKM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recieved this device for Christmas, and was a little concerned given all the negative reviews I've seen.

I have no complains for their customer service.  Velocity Micro as a company is a different story.  But first, the tablet itself.Out of the box, everything seemed set up for success.  The features were decent for the price, the tablet itself is nicely designed, a stand is included, the instruction manual was short but helpful, and the tablet came fully charged.  Unfortunately, the good design stopped there.First, the screen, while acceptable during initial testing, is clearly not the highest quality.  Text was fuzzy, more so than the 800x600 resolution would warrant.  Text was even fuzzier than on my wife's 3rd generation iPod touch. Since the T301 is sold as an eReader or Reading Tablet, text clarity is crucial, and the tablet fails on that count.Since the tablet has the Kindle for Android app \"pre-installed\" I expected that Kindle, of all the apps, would work fine.  I signed in and downloaded a few books out of my Archived Items.  I opened a book that I had been previously reading.  It crashed.  I opened another book.  It crashed.  A few other books.  One or two worked.  I thought perhaps an update would help.  I downloaded the latest version of the Kindle app from the Cruz Market.  That didn't help.  I tried restarting the tablet.  That didn't help.After perhaps an hour of constant crashes in the Kindle app, I decided to try some other eReader apps.  The Nook app wouldn't install.  The Kobo app installed but I didn't have sufficient time to test it.  I can understand some other eReader apps not working/installing properly, since the tablet only runs Android 2.0, but why doesn't the built-in Kindle app work?I decided to try the web browser.  I discovered that the screen, while capacitive, is nothing like an iPod Touch, or a basic Android phone.  Instead, you have to press firmly to scroll.  The web browser crashed.  The tablet even rebooted at one point while trying to use the browser.A few other basic apps are included, and those worked for the most part.  But I didn't buy the tablet to check email or update Twitter; I wanted to read my Kindle books.I decided it was time to call tech support.  I was at queue position 36.  Two hours and fifteen minutes later, I was finally at queue position 2.  When I got through and the phone started ringing, I discovered my two hours of waiting had landed me in...you guessed it...a voicemail box.  No apology, no \"sorry to keep you waiting for two hours when you could have left a message after 5 minutes.\"  I left a message, expecting a call back the next day.  No call by noon, so I called back.  Once again, queue position 25.  I called sales.  They were also busy.  I called PR and got in touch with a friendly but unempowered individual who promised to have support call me back \"as soon as possible.\"  Midnight Thursday night, and still no call.  Repeated attempts to reach tech support earlier on Thursday landed me in the queue at positions 26, 18, and 15.Perhaps I received a defective device, but due to my inability to reach tech support, or even sales, or even get a human being to answer my calls, and due to the constant crashes and loss of functionality, I cannot recommend this tablet.For what it's worth, the T103 Cruz Tablet I played with at Borders before buying the T301 had similar crashes, but I had hoped it was only their much-abused display model that had issues.  Now I suspect it is the cheap parts and poorly configured software on the Velocity Micro tablets/ereaders that is at fault.Don't buy the T301.  Save your money for another tablet, like an iPad or Nook Color, or else just buy a Kindle.  Having used all three of those devices previously, they are leaps and bounds ahead of Velocity Micro's offerings.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised!", "Author": "B. Montgomery", "ReviewID": "RAN88P26F3CPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Velocity Cruz Tablet T301 expecting to have an E-READER, as well as a light, internet tool to play with around airports, public spaces, etc. when I couldn't be near a computer. I will have to say, I have fallen IN LOVE with this Tablet! I commute on a daily basis downtown, so I am very happy that I was able to download all my books on this device. (You have the KINDLE app and BORDERS app included on the device) The only bummer is I can't seem to get the NOOK app to download on the device, so if you love Barnes & Noble that's something to think about. (I even went on freewarelovers.com and it allows you to download the link, but it won't finish the download once on your device.) Speaking of freewarelovers.com, this website has TONS of cool free Android apps to download that are super easy to install, I have downloaded a lot and continue to see more updated daily, so make this website a favorite because you'll be using it a lot! (Anyone know any other cool websites to download from???)The tablet is very fast on the internet, and has great colors and clarity for websites, as well as an awesome zoom capability! Also, one cool thing to note with the Kindle App is you are able to make the screen white, sepia, or black (for night time reading) as well as highlight sentences which can open up the dictionary (already installed) while reading to let you know what something means, as well as add notes to certain sentences if you happen to be studying, reading something of importance, etc.All in all, for the price it is, I would have to say I am VERY satisfied with my purchase. I wasn't willing to spend $400+ for a tablet, I just wanted a good machine that would allow me to read my books from multiple e-reading sites, as well as allow me to go on Facebook, Email, and any other websites!! This tablet has allowed me to do that, and a bit more! :) I have also downloaded the PANDORA app, so it's very nice to listen to music while reading and browsing the web. Speakers sound nice!!! (Headphone plug as well)Cons: At this moment, we are not able to get on the Android Market, so you are cut off from certain apps because they are connected to that Marketplace. (Hence freewarelovers) I'm hoping Velocity will open that up because that would be awesome!! Also, no flash player, I believe you have to find an app. to play videos on-line. Saw a few for youtube, etc. just haven't put on my Tablet yet. Also, as stated before, no NOOK app available for this yet. (Even tried putting it on SD Card and transferring to Tablet, will not work.)Pros: Great size, awesome e-reader capabilities, fast internet, all websites are colorful/detailed and will fit to the tablet screen (not small websites that are hard to read), cool apps, long battery life. (Mine will last about a week, and that's both reading for about an hour everyday, and surfing the web for an hour everyday. Can go longer if WIFI is turned off.) and cheap SD cards you can buy to have a larger file if you feel that 8GB is too small.Anyhoo, Hope this review was helpful, I know that I was very nervous to buy the Tablet after a few reviews I read. But I can tell you, I think you'll be very surprised and pleased with what a great little purchase this is. And again, if you're looking for an IPAD, this is not it. (Has similarities.. but not it at all.) So if I were you, I would either spend the money and get the IPAD, or spend less and get this item without the disappointment or regrets. :) Happy Shopping!", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price.", "Author": "P.

It is a bit slow, no app market (but I have installed .apk files from the web with no problems) the screen is ok, takes a bit of getting used to, but for a little over $200 you do get a great reader, I like it very much as a reader (updated the Kindle app) you also get a pretty good portable media player with a 'full sized' SD card reader, an ok web browser, true no flash (but I don't think you get flash on the iPad either)...I got this device to see if a tablet would be something I would use long term, as a test case for future buys...so far I think it was a great buy and first taste of the tablet experience. I will most likely wait a bit before my next tablet, first because between the T301 and my smartphone I can do anything I would want to do in the mobile world, and secondly I feel that by the end of this year the Android tablets will really come into there own and I think the end of this year will be the right time to upgrade to a full fledged tablet.

Like having a soundtrack for a movie.That is unitl the one downloaded book that I actually purchased, couldn't be recalled 4 weeks later. Borders promised over 99 free downloadable books. Slim pickings of not very interesting books. The books I did download for free, however became unaccessible at the same time my purchased book did. The book cover icons remained in my library, but the device would try to upload the books and say, \"This book cannot be accessed right now, our site is working on this problem.\"VIDEO PLAYBACK is a JOKE.I uploaded a 10second vid from my PC -that had originated from my camera. It only half worked before freezing up the entire device and I'd have to exit the program and re-enter it just to see 3 seconds of the vid. It's impressive \"lookin\" but don't believe the hype. After a while, My Velocity Cruz Tablet just completely would not work at all. It couldn't be reset, couldn't be recharged. I took Took it back to borders and got a refund.Oh and get this, Before I took it back, I called Borders cuz I loved it so much, I was willing to settle for a replacement. I mean it was a gift, I figured I could work through the kinks. The Border's lady said, \"All the ones we have are returns and have to go back as defective\" -She said she'd call around town and find me one. \"She called me back and said \"No Borders in our city had them in stock.\"  She was like, I guess we haven't really ordered any new ones.  Well I guess Border's wouldn't order any new ones, the Christmas season is over and everyone's got wind that the Velocity Cruz is a piece of expensive JUNK- Border's, who's going outta business unloaded this crap onto the public, and the public unloaded it RIGHT BACK.Since I've seen them all over Home Shopping Channels at $150...it's trash and they're still trying to sucker people into buying them.The device is defective. They know it and they'r still trying to unload it on the unsuspecting public. Should be illegal.I saw on YouTube Wal-Mart is apparently selling them 50% off now. There is a reason it's 50% off. Its a dud. A dummy. Don't get suckered in. My mom bought it from Borders on 12/21, by February I couldn't charge it, couldn't reset it, it was just a blank, black pretty piece of trash.Prior to conking out, my books DISAPPEARED. It showed their icons but then \"errored\" and I couldn't read them. My mom paid a total of $466 -That was for the CRUZ, PROTECTIVE SLEEVE, EXTENDED WARRANTY. We got all her $ back about 2 weeks ago.EDITED TO SAY: Maybe I'm not being fair to Borders. I'm sure they didn't 'unload this device' as I accused them of. I'm sure they thought they were selling a reputalbe device that could rival/compete witht the IPAD/Kindle etc etc...I'm sure they've not ordered any more for stock because they've realized the ones they did sell are being returned for unforseen defects and I'm sure they've made the conscious decision not to burden their customers with this device any longer.They were very kind to me for the most part when I returned the device.  So while I've ragged equally on Borders and the Velocity Cruz, what it boils down to is my whole-hearted disappointment that my new Christmas toy of which I cherished with all it's kinks and flaws ultimately did not work out for ME.That said, Borders in and of itself is KEWL in my book.

And it sounds like the tech support is lacking, though I have no personal experience with this myself.There have been a few fake reviews that were recently removed from this product page...so beware that overly positive writeups may in fact not be from actual users not employed by VM.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love it!!

I really wanted a Kindle but my significant other decided I should get something more versatile. We tried two other e-readers prior to purchasing the Cruz. Our 1st purchase was a Pandigital Novel e-reader and it was totally a big disappointment. We couldn't download books and couldn't really find any technical support help. So we returned it to the store. Our 2nd purchase was the Coby Kyros tablet and it was a total waste of time. Totally not what we wanted so we promptly returned it. So we kept our expectations low when we purchased the Cruz. Being totally honest I just wanted to read and I preferred to read on the kindle app. The Cruz came pre-loaded with the Kindle app so I felt like I was in heaven. My memory card has caused me to delete and re-install the kindle app twice but other than that no complaints. I called technical support when I was having problems with the kindle app (for the 2nd time) and my call was answered promptly and my problem was solved within a couple of minutes. I don't think we could've made a better choice unless we went with the Ipad and you can call me cheap but I'm not paying Ipad prices. So for me the cruz tablet rocks!!", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than they'd have you believe...", "Author": "M.G.", "ReviewID": "RJIDIXWCPZWBQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, I can't take it any more.  I've been regularly consulting Amazon's user reviews of this device since I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my wife six weeks ago.  Since that time, I've read countless reviews unmercifully bludgeoning the T301 as completely useless and incapable.  Not so, say I.I will agree that it is somewhat frustrating to find a number of popular apps that won't work on this device; I'll grant you that.  But with some patience and fortitude, you will be able to find a goodly number that do in fact work just fine.  Or at least that was the case with us.And for the price we paid, I am absolutely pleased with what we've gotten out of the device.  The things it does well include:1)  ACCESSING WI-FI throughout our house, it always seems to lock onto the signal from our wireless router, and does so from that point without interruption.  The device also detects other nearby wi-fi networks within the neighborhood, and I note that it seems to be more capable of doing this than my kids' IPod Touch's.  (i.e. more sensitive)2)  INTERNET ACCESS - We are able to access the \"mobile\" version of many popular websites, and surfing is generally pretty gratifying with this device.  It's certainly not the same as doing so from a desktop or laptop, but it's not bad either.  As others have noted, Dolphin HD is a good choice, and arguably a better browser than the one that came pre-loaded on the T301.3)  FACEBOOK - My wife, unlike myself, is an avid Facebook follower.  This device performs admirably in this regard, and she has generally been very pleased with its capabilities.  No complaints here.4)  YOUTUBE - This is somewhat hit and miss, and admittedly wasn't one of the things we cared too much about when we made this purchase.  That said, there are many Youtube videos that play well on the device, including those embedded within Facebook posts and e-mail. Again though, it can be somewhat hit and miss.5)  E-MAIL - The stock e-mail program that comes with the device is somewhat rudimentary, but it serves its purpose.  The program is certainly not as robust as MS Outlook, for instance, but it generally does what it was meant to do and does so well. (presuming that your primary goal is to use it for the purposes of downloading, reading and perhaps responding to an e-mail or two)6) FILE MANAGEMENT / STORAGE -  I purchased a 32gb SD card and installed it shortly after purchasing the T301.  It was immediately recognized without problem, and has been ever since.  This increases the device storage many times over what it came with originally, at nominal cost. (noting that Apple devices do not allow such upgrades at all)I should also mention that it is a very simple matter to transfer files and content between this device and a computer.  I've successfully loaded apps both from a PC, via USB cable, and wirelessly.  (Pay CAREFUL attention to the \"tethering\" instructions, and particularly the following:  \"Long-tap the status bar and drag to reveal more options. Tap 'USB connect.' Tap the button 'Turn on USB storage' in the bottom right of the screen to make Internal storage shown in your PC.\")7) PERFORMANCE - We've had little trouble with the device crashing, even after challenging it by playing videos, opening multiple apps at one time, and playing music from online services such as Pandora.  I've only had to use the \"paper clip trick\" to reset the device once, and that was when I first took it out of the package.  (as it otherwise wouldn't turn on)  I do agree that the device can at times be somewhat \"sluggish\" - for instance, when first loading a YouTube video or first opening the Kindle application.  Once you become accustomed to its behavior however, and your expectations are adjusted accordingly, this to me is not a big deal.  (when one weighs it against the benefits of having the internet right there at your fingertips, to carry with you where you please)8)  E-READER CAPABILITIES - I mentioned the Kindle app.  The T301 works seamlessly within Kindle, and with the Amazon app store in general.  It downloads and scrolls through e-books very adeptly, and we've also found various useful newsreader apps that allow us to access a variety of online newspapers and news sources.  Again, no complaints here.9)  BATTERY LIFE - Splendid.  It'll easily last through a day's \"normal\" use, from what we've seen.  Very impressive.10) USER FRIENDLINESS - It took a little getting used to, coming from using my kids' IPod Touch's.  That said, we've settled into using it and are now very comfortable navigating around within this tablet.  Everything is generally very intuitive, and the capacitive touch screen is arguably (and remarkably) just as sensitive as an IPod Touch.  Again, very impressive given its relatively low cost.11) AUDIO/VISUAL CAPABILITIES - While not \"hi-fi\" in the least, the built in speakers are definitely convenient. I haven't as of yet confirmed whether the headphone output is stereo or not, although I see that some have suggested that it's monaural.  Screen resolution is a step below the IPod Touch, no doubt, but generally quite adequate.  The color re-creation is good, as are the brightness and contrast, in my opinion.On balance, we've been extremely pleased with and pleasantly surprised by the T301 - particularly given its price point, as well as some of the curmudgeon-like reviews (ahem) herein.  I honestly feel that this tablet has been given a bad rap by many of the reviews I've seen here, and this is what compelled me to write my own - so as to \"set the record straight\" based upon our own, generally positive experience.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "Dylan Fan", "ReviewID": "RVXD74N86298O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A purchased this on woot for about $75 refurbished, basically because it was cheap and I wanted to give an android tablet a try (I have an ipad I use daily).  So, my expectations were extremely low given the early adopter experience with iPad which was excellent, and the bargain base price.  The unit came already upgraded to Android 2.2 (those with 2.0 can upgrade at the Cruz website).The device is a comfortable size and weight.  It comes preloaded with a number of apps, including web browser, email, Kindle, a dictionary, OfficeSuite, etc.  After reading about the Android 2.0 version I was concerned it wouldn't have an easy easy way to download apps, but was surprised to find \"Cruz Market\".  Unfortunately, there are few apps available.  I haven't found an adobe reader, which would be something useful, but there is little else I would have expected which isn't present.  Also, haven't found Netflix app yet.Principal complaint to date is that it is evidently processor and/or memory challenged as some things happen quite slowly, although not unbearably so.  I notice it, for example, during page turns on the Kindle app or when rendering pages in the browser.  Still, it is fast enough for most purposes.  And secondly, the screen isn't as bright as that on the iPad (again, it costs a fraction).I actually think I like the keyboard better than the iPad's.  Build seems solid overall.Overall, while somewhat underpowered and not many apps are available, I think it is an excellent low-priced device for those interesting in getting something at low cost that will do the basics (e-reading, web surfing, youtube, email. and a few other basic tasks) without spending a fortune.Oh yeah -- network setup was easy.  This device seems to be finding its way to the coffee table in front of my TV, where having a computer around is always handy.  Although, the suggestion has been made that it be left in the bathroom as a reader, which may be its eventual disposition.I guess I'll keep it and use it for something.  Not an iPad but doesn't have an iPad pricetag either.  Excellent value IMO.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "what works..., its depends.., a great value!", "Author": "L. Cooke", "ReviewID": "R2GIOWQPVH1QHV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hey All,First, this tablet is fine as a general internet access, reader, and simple office services device.  What it is not is a media entertainment device, a full service pc or a phone.Me?, I'm a simple network and information systems engineer.  What got me here is a lark.  The bride, an avid reader needed a Christmas present, when I had suggested a reader, it got shot-down, so I looked around for alternatives.  However, when it came to it, it was clear that the most cost effective solution was going to be a reader; however, it had to have multiple uses, be in color, an internet portal, easy to use and cheap.Well, the closer Christmas came the less choices there were.  The issue was my criteria could only be met by a $200+ device.  That is until I found the Cruz reader for a mere $120.  It offered reader capabilities, color, internet web access and could double as a mp3 player.  That there was a domestic web presence for  acessories and support was the clincher.  My wife was hesitant at first; however, within 2 hours she was very comfortable with the operation and reader functions.  Within 4 hours she was downloading music and jamming to her favorite tunes.  After 6 months she was still elated.  All this from a textile CNC specialist--Textile/Window Treatment Artistian who up to 6 months earlier could not load anti-virus software on her laptop.So, here I was with a dying laptop (Dell B-130) and a birthday.  Knowing my background my wife realized I would not be happy with a resistive screen.  When she went looking, she first looked over the Cruz T-103; but, they were no longer available or the vendor would not allow returns.  Luckily, she found a brick and mortor offering a Cruz T-301 at no more then 5% more then the best mail order price.  Well, knowing the price at the time being above $200, and older cheaper models no longer being available I was not expecting what was in the gift bag the morning of my birthday.So what can I tell you now two weeks later, well one this is as close to a notebook computer running linux as you can get.  For a young person with simple internet gaming or social networking needs, this device is perfect.  At the sametime, for an executive or sales person needing to keep in touch, creating, editing and reading Office compatible documents and spreadsheets this is a great tool.Though not a phone, this device can connect to most Wi-Fi devices effortlessly.  Through this connection it is possible to access most any app necessary to perform most services you buy a laptop for at 1/10-1/100th the cost of an equivalent Microsoft or McIntosh product.There are a few cons, mainly limited to a lack of flash video viewing, and what appears to be a non-stereo or mono earphone jack.  (You can plug in a stereo earphone; but, will only hear the right channel.)  Though Amazon offers many android apps, due to the internal ram being limited to 256Mb versus 512Mb some apps for android 2.2 will down load; but, not install.  Slowly the Amazon apps store is adjusting the apps made available that will be compatible with your tablet.  Though not an issue for me, the lack of a microphone and web-camera for a \"Skype\" equivalent voice  or video capability may be an issue.  Also, I have not tested it; but, a compatible usb keyboard or keyboard lap-docking system would be a welcome addition.After acting as  a sysadmn for Unix System V, Linux in all of it's various flavors, Xenix/SCO, BSD, as well as supervisor for Novell and administrator for Windows Servers starting with the pre NT version, I can share not having root access is a bit frustrating; however, this also provides a sense of security, to put  it simple it is unlikely you can hurt it.  (Though you might want to keep a reset paper clip handy incase of a lockup when adding apps.)This is not a toy or a through away, nor is it a serious pc.  What it is, is a nice simple tool to access web services, read electronic books, listen to a little music, play a few games and write or read Office documents or roughly acts as a simple laptop you can nearly carry in your pocket.  Not bad for half the cost of a Notebook or cheap Laptop.Cheers!Dave Cooke", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Velocity Micro T301 Disappointment", "Author": "Keith W.

You may believe that you are buying a Cruz t301 with 4gb internal memory (along with a bundled 4gb external sd card). I am sorry to burst your bubble and perhaps save you some trouble but this tablet, while still being the t301, it is NOT the 4gb internal memory one but the TWO gb internal memory version of the t301 Cruz tablet and it DOES NOT COME bundled with ANY extra sd card(s).Now, onto my review of this, the TWO gigabyte internal flash memory t301 Cruz tablet:The screen is very responsive to my touch, almost TOO responsive. Sometimes I want it to STOP scrolling or it will hit too many keys at once because of the featherlight touch required with the integral keyboard. I have also used the Reader so maybe I was more sensitive to the tablet's touch-screen compared with the hard jabbing one must proceed with when engaging the Cruz Reader's touch-screen. After some clumsy starts I got the \"Feel\" for the touch-screen and I must say that I really do enjoy it much more than I ever did the Reader's.It comes with the Kindle reading app pre-installed and for those who use Kindle and read the Kindle ebooks this is a great thing. For me I did not care much for it so I uninstalled it right away and installed my old stand-by reading app; (Aldiko) which works wonderfully with this tablet.There are a few apps that are different that the Cruz Reader (r101) and most are pointless fun like \"Solitaire\" and \"Sudoku\". Though, I've found the \"InkPad\" app to be a little bit of fun for practicing creative writing or if you wish to keep a little diary on your tablet.The video player is wonderful to me. One of the main differences between the Cruz Reader (again r101) and the Cruz tablet is the difference in available video file formats for the media player. The Reader will only play versions of mp4 videos whereas the tablet will play mp4, MOV, and, (my favorite!) AVI files! It will play all sorts of different .avi files. Also, the video player has never given me any of those \"Sorry, Cannot Play Video\" error messages and the audio does NOT cut off at all when inserting headphones, (both problems of the Reader).Battery Life: For my experience; and I know some people's Cruz tablets are different, my battery is amazingly long. Although, when I first opened up my Cruz from the mailbox it didn't look so promising; I pulled out my tablet and found that the battery was completely dead. It wouldn't even hold a charge long enough to turn on.Here is when I made the first negative discovery of MY particular Cruz tablet that my sister, who has the same exact brand although the 4gb instead of the 2gb, does not share: My tablet will NOT charge nor even register at all the presence of a dc-in wall charger. Either the one that it came with or others. It simply will not charge via the dc-port/wall. However, it WILL charge via the mini-usb port either tethered to the main house computer or to a mini-usb wall/car charger. So, thank heavens I already had a dual-mini-usb wall/car charger on hand I had bought at Walmart about a year ago and it works beautifully with it.Allowing my tablet to charge on the usb wall charger for the night in the morning around seven or eight I will remove it from the charger and proceed to use the tablet off and on all day going on until after midnight or so and more often than not I will still have half a good charge left on the device nearing two or three a.m. after being off the charger all day.Though, I must explain about one small little quirk of my tablet that I don't know if anyone else has the same issue. It's not really that much of a hassle, just a curiosity, really: In the morning when I go to unplug it from the usb wall charger the green led light will be aglow and the battery life indicator will show it refusing to charge but it will show it to be only charged up around half-way. The green bar will be half-covered. BUT, when, and this happens every time, I reboot the device and once it comes back to life the led light will, of course stay green, but then the battery indicator on the screen will now show a completely FULL battery for the beginning of the day and start the slow discharge towards whenever I return it to the charger.All in all: This device is good for ebooks and video, (avi!), pictures and simple tasks; writing, calculating your bills, etc, playing cards, or whatever other apps you want to install.The wifi is good provided you can find a good hotspot or someone nearby lets you use theirs. I got a fun little free Police Scanner app that uses the internet to work that scans police and fire trucks radios from all over the US and England and some of Scotland. That's fun to listen to. Oh, be sure to head over to the Cruz main website and upgrade your firmware to 2.2 right off the bat!Remember: This tablet is the 2gb t301 version that does not come with any sd cards so you might want to do yourself a favor and order an external standard-size 4gb/16gb or 32gb sd card to go along with your new tablet.In parting: It is a good tablet for those who have a lot of patience, tender-loving-care and who aren't afraid of getting their hands metaphorically dirty with figuring out all the ins and outs of the technical mumbo-jumbo of really making the device YOUR OWN.Enjoy!", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted.", "Author": "TY", "ReviewID": "R1VO269H95SLIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not looking for a tablet to use everyday, only when I travel.

My daughter watches the You-Tube music videos upstairs with her skullcandy earbuds,.. no hesitation with the 256 Ram. Did I mention the great display?

I was surprised to notice that whatever I ordered one for Kindle or Cruz, it would show up available to install on the others.  So they all have whatever I purchased, linked thru my amazon account.

She was so set on getting the Ipad, but I told her why get the Ipad when I know you are not going to use everything the Ipad has to offer. I knew she just wanted a tablet so I looked into getting an inexpensive tablet to where she can do everything she wanted to do. I came across this tablet and was amazed at what it could do. So without further research I purchased it. When you get the tablet you have to update it, then you can start putting apps on it. There are alot of apps you can put on your tablet the catch is you need the right model for the apps to be downloaded, and it was not shown when I purchased it. Pretty much everything you want to watch will require Adobe flash player which is on the tablet when you purchase it but when you update the tablet you will lose the flash player and you can not put it back because the T301 is not equiped with the flash player specifications. In conclusion I had to return her tablet and purchase the PS47 which is going to do everything she wants it to do. Watch netflix movies, her dowloaded movies, pictures, music, everything. If this is things you are wanting, purchase the PS47 or T400 series' not this 301. This is a good buy but not for someone who wants to do multiple things with their tablet.Velocity Micro Cruz Tablet PS47 - 7-Inch Android Tablet (Black)", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cruz T301 is worth checking out", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"ladyblessedn4gvn\"", "ReviewID": "R3HLQKS754ZT97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say that if you are limited on funds but are wanting to experience a tablet the Cruz T301 is a good choice. I picked mine up for $99 and it comes with a soft case and a stand in addition to the other normal things such as charger. I started researching what it could do prior to the delivery, and unfortunately became a little scared when I saw so many negative reviews. Needless to say it is important to remember prior to adding any programs to upgrade android to 2.2. This is very easy and instructions are on the Cruz website. After that you send your email address to amazon and they send you a link to download the Amazon Market App store, and the perks are they have a free paid app every day. Other markets to download are Slideme, 1Market, andApp store, and Mobile9. If you are looking for other apps but are unable to find them google them in their .apk format. Another thing to remember is if the app you are wanting to run will not install is that you may have to pick an older version of that app.Another HUGE thing to remember with the Cruz T301 is to get as big a SDHC card (32 gb max.) as you can. I started out with an 8 gb sdhc and it wasn't the experience that I wanted. I took the micro sd from my phone which was 16 gb put it in the adapter and it worked immediately (there were also experiences that micro sd would not work with T301). It is much faster now.The only keyboard sub I found that will work is A.I. Type keyboard which is free through Amazon Market. As far as the tablet not having Google Market I do not find that a loss except in the sense of apps that I had bought through them. What I really don't miss is the constant almost forced updating I have to undo on my phone on a weekly basis for Google Apps that I don't use.Oh, did I mention movies? It totally rocks. I transferred a couple from my laptop in .avi format and began watching them immediately. Still you have to remember if Flash is a requirement for the purchase of a tablet this is not the one for you (some people have to have flash to access college classes). Also if you are a huge YouTube watcher I have not yet been able to get that to work even with Skyfire (recommended by Cruz).I hope this review offsets the many negative ones that were expecting this to perform like android 2.3 and up. For the price I am more that happy with my experience. Now to get a case and screen protector.Okay, so my opinion on the bettering of the experience when you throw in Google android programming has changed. This is a week to the day after the delivery of my tablet and I love it. I found yesterday the link to add google android market and google apps to my tablet and they all work, and the best thing is I did not have to root my tablet. I am a novice and can not afford to buy another tablet at this point. Anyway, I am now able to access the Android Market. The tablet runs even better after adding the Google software as before I could not get YouTube to download video and play them. Yesterday I watched a 24 minute episode without any problems at all. It still does not have flash, but I have been able to enjoy downloaded movies on it, as well as content through YouTube.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Deeply Disappointed", "Author": "Christopher C.

Do not buy this tablet.About five minutes after I started using the Velocity Micro T301 tablet (after allowing it to charge overnight) the screen went blank. The bottom line is that I ended up sending it back to Velocity five times. Each time it was returned, the same problem occurred - the screen went blank. I could not turn it off nor turn it on. About the third time I sent it back, Velocity indicated to me that they had replaced the item. However, when I received it back, I checked the serial number to find that they had not actually exchanged the item. The last time I sent it back, I demanded that the item be replaced and indicated that I had written down the serial number so they could not BS me.I few days ago received the item from Velocity...Well, they had replaced the tablet, or at least changed the serial number on the tablet. This time I was actually able to use the tablet for a full day. When I returned home that night, I plugged it in to charge it overnight. Guess what? The next morning, when I tried to activate it, the bloody thing won't turn on. At this point I have given up. I've turned it into an expensive door stop.However, the Sony PSP keeps working. I've never had a problem with it and I can watch movies, access the internet, and play games. I've owned it for years. I also own a Sony Touch e-book reader and I've never had a problem with it either. I've taken the hint and just purchased a Sony SGPT112US/S Wi-Fi Tablet (32GB) through Amazon. I figure that since my other Sony products have worked flawlessly, this one should too.Do not buy this tablet. You will regret it.

What I received was a T301 with 2 GB internal flash and no SD card.  Suffice it to say that I did not get what was advertised.  The vendor, Worldwide Distributors, sent a 4 GB SD card later but would not upgrade to the 4 GB model.  They offered a refund but I decided to keep what I got and avoid a trip to the post office and more wasted time.  I wish I had listened to one of the reviews below that warned of this.As for the device, I concur with most of the reviews.  It is definitely not an IPad.  It is more of a big Android based phone.  Once I upgraded the OS to version 2.2 and loaded some apps it worked okay.  It was pretty much what I expected and suits most of my needs.  It is compact and travels well.  The installed ebook app works fine and it gets decent Internet access.  Don't expect full browsing capability, however, since you mostly get directed to mobile app web pages.  For instance, I tried to get to Google Maps and the Skyfire browser just died.  I suspect the 256 KB RAM is culprit. It is also a little slow but I expected that given the processor it has.  The external SD storage of up 32 GB is a nice feature as well as the replaceable battery.All in all, I like this device.  If you want to do online banking while watching TV or take it with you on the road to check e-mail then it is a good purchase.  I advise that you get a T301 with 4 GB + internal storage because all your downloads and app installs default to internal memory and that gets used up rather quickly on a 2 GB model.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Could be better, but for the price very good for the cost", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3PKGGZLL5B6OD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For $160 really and amazing device but it should ship with a paper clip (necessary to reset) which in heavy non Ebook uses (as I do 95% tablet use and multi tasking... multi DL and Apps) you likely might have to do every  few days. And if you do just don't click it.... hold it in reset at least 10 sec. (makes a difference)  Over all very pleased for cost. Compared to the cheaper Reader version... much better and more sensitive/accurate touch screen. Thought tech same res looks better too.  $350 cheaper than a base iPad (which offer no ext memory) but capable of near. Also unlike iPad small enough to still fit in a at least male large pant pocket, vs carry around only. Yet still a nice large sreen you can full page browse on. And the sites that mobile auto detect huge easy to read for even the partially blind. (reading glasses crowd)  Also unlike iPad comes with a very nice soft sleeve (that now carries a paper clip in bottom too  ;) )  Also boots much faster than some Android phones I have seen so power down vs stand by not a big deal vs standby if not to be used for a while. (well under two min)  Battery life vs many cheap devices is very good too, even doing live web video and background DL wifi full time easily over 5 hours.

When I first tested this tablet, I was disappointed by the rather slow performance. However, after the android 2.2 upgrade, the performance increased dramatically.

Also to address the issue many have brought up about the tablet not supporting the official android app store, it actually supports the Amazon appstore which is a much richer experience with many exclusive free apps.Positives: sleek design with durable rubberized back, bright clear screen, snappy dual core processor, pretty responsive touchscreen, sd card slot, comes with case and stand, incredible price.Negatives: difficult to sync to a computer since no usb cable provided, and usb drive doesn't even really work anyway on the tablet, overly glossy screen, could be faster", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kindle App Clunky and Frustrating", "Author": "Hibernian \"Ex-Top Ten Percenter\"", "ReviewID": "R1HMZY3LNNMIOZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought a Cruz T-301 one week ago and have spent quite a bit of time with it.  For the money it's not that bad.  It has lots of apps and many of them are useful and good to have.  However, I really wanted it for the Kindle app more than anything and that part has been disappointing.  It is very unstable and does just about what it wants to do rather than what you want it to. It's not the least bit user friendly.  Try to remove a book from the device and you can't get the option menu to come up.  Often you try and the app just shuts down on its own.  When you have a book open and want to go back to the beginning or to search within the book you're lucky if you can get the menu to come up so you can manuever like you want to.  If you keep tapping the screen the page will either advance or retreat or just bounce around a little.  Eventually you may see the menu come up so you can change your location.  It really should work better than this and I suspect it was thrown together in a hurry to get it on the market rather than developed as a quality app.  If this app worked like it's supposed to I'd give the Cruz 5 stars.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "EReader +++++", "Author": "Dyanne Gray", "ReviewID": "R1DG0AY3U0QQ2G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After my local library started offering e-books I decided it was time for an e-reader.  Knowing that I did not want a Kindle ( Was not a supported devise at my Library) I started my search.  I was looking at both readers and tablets and was almost set on buying the Nook Color when I saw the T301 on Amazon.  After reading the specs, reviews both here and at Cnet and also the fact that the player was $177.00 ( and I had a $20.00 GF ) I must say that after an initial learning curve the first night I am very pleased with this very affordable tablet.  Is it an ipad?  No, of course not, but you get a lot of bang for your buck and as a small, fit in your bag, portable device you really can't go wrong.  As far as down loading apps, just by pass loading directly from Cruz market, and use your computer to go to the app site, and down load directly on to your dedicated SD card, then just open and download.  This this  is only 2.0 android, but as long as you don't try to download any app that needs higher, you should not have a problem.  The Cruz comes with a 4GB SD card, I have already purchased a 32GB as I can tell I will need it.  The nice thing is you can run multiple cards ( one for Video, one for books), and pop them in and out depending on what you want at the time if you exceed 32 GG ( or 4 GB) I down loaded some video and it plays great!!

The first T301 I received stop working with in 5 min of use.  I contacted World Wide and they told me to send it back and they did send me a new one.I received the new T301 and this one worked. Well, it worked for a week and than went blank to never again start up.  I contacted World wide and they told me to contact the manufacturer which I did. Velocity informed me that World Wide is not an Authorized reseller of the T301 so Velocity can not help me.  At this time I am the proud owner of a $135 piece of junk that no one seems to want to deal with.I will reserve my opinion on World Wide since I have not heard back from them on this issue since I told World Wide that Velocity will do nothing to help, but I will give my opinion on the T301.I can't believe I'm the only person that has a T301 that just stopped working. After receiving two of them and both stopped working in the same manner I am guessing there is something inherently wrong with the hardware or firmware in this unit.If anyone wants to buy this unit to use as a reader be ware that outside it is useless since you can not see any text on the screen.Over all the unit would have been a nice mini computer to take on a trip to check e-mails and do minor task on line.Within the week that I used the T301 many times I would be reading the screen and the screen would turn up side down and I'd have to turn it around to continue with my reading.  Twice the second unit failed but when I hit the reset button it came back on.  This should have told me that something bad was going to happen.The instructions for the T301 are minimal and needs a lot of help to make it user friendly.I have finally received an e-mail from Amazon saying I will not get a refund for the defective Android since WW policy was clear that the Item must be returned in the original packaging.  For a company to see two T301 Androids and both failed one within 5 min of use and the second within a week and than hide behind a policy that calls for the item to be returned in the original package.  I do not and I do not know many people keep the original package after the item bought worked correctly.  I am disappointed, frustrated and angry to lose $159 for a defective piece of equipment.  I will never again purchase any item sold by World Wide.  Even the manufacture does not recognize World Wide as an authorized re-seller for the T301.  This is a red flag for me, thinking maybe World Wide is selling T301's that are not a Class one Item.  I have also notified Amazon that I will never again purchase Items from a third seller but only purchase Items being sold through Amazon.  Well time for the to toss $159 worth of junk into the trash and find a more reliable company to buy a new Android.

I didn't think not having Android Market access would be a big deal.  I didn't think that only running Android 2.0 would be a big deal.  Well, after trying to set this thing up for her over the past week, I've learned that both of those things are HUGE deals.The Cruz market has slim pickings when it comes to applications and many other third party app locations link to the Android Market, which you cannot access to download from.  Searching for apps that work on Android 2.0 has been a challenge to put it mildly.  I've installed and un-installed so many times from this tablet that it spontaneously reboots itself and has a weird static noise that emits from the speakers occasionally.  I think it may be associated with another app that isn't working properly...The pros are that the screen resolution and responsiveness are decent, the battery life is phenomenal and the price is right.  It is a sturdy well made tablet and has a nice design.  My mother will mainly be using this tablet to play games, surf the net, check email and read books, so I think it will work out well for her.I've installed ADW Launcher on this Cruz, as well as Fancy Widget (for clock and weather), BetterCuts, AppOrganizer, Advanced Task Killer Pro, Advanced Task Manager and several games that include Jewels, Bubble Popper Pro, Minesweeper for Android, Solitaire and Sudoku.  Some games built for later versions of Android will run, but they are small and justified to the upper left hand portion of the screen which looks odd.  Your best bet is to search for apps that run on Android 1.6.If you're looking for a color e-reader, ability to check email and surf the internet in a portable device that is priced right, this one is for you.  For the more advanced android tablet user, I suggest looking elsewhere... I'll personally be waiting for the Asus eeePad MeMo (June $499) or the Aluratek Cinepad (April $299) to come out.EDIT:  This tablet turned out to be a HUGE disappointment.

I feel that with the mods available on this site I have a fairly good working tablet/reader. How I managed to get there is not something I'd ask anyone to do after getting a gift. Also, anyone you get this for is going to want to compare it to an iPad and if it can't run games like the iPad it's just not going to work for them. If all they need is an inexpensive color device to read Kindle books and you can find one for 100.00 or less, then ok get it. If you are buying this for yourself, want something to tinker with, and know up front it's not going to perform like an iPad (and you are OK with that) by all means find one at a cheap price < $100 and go for it, any more it's simply not worth the money.It's also built well and feels good in your hands. Once I got it straightened out web browsing and e-mail worked well. The only lingering issue I have is with a program called Dropbox.The badApp compatibility is horrendous. Getting an app to run on the T301 is a hit or miss affair that in many cases required me to do a factory reset to recover from. Popular games like Angry Birds simply will not run at present. That may change at some point, but it's not going to be enabled by the manufacturer.It's slow. Right out of the box I had problems. I had to use the reset button simply to power it on the first time. Once it was up I noticed that the screen was not very responsive and the apps perform poorly. You can get them doing better if you root the device and tweak it, but that's asking a little much of a pre-teen or grandmother to do. This is not a good device for a child, they will be so disappointed.I had to flash mine to 2.2.3 before it would work for practically anything (e-mail, web, etc.). Again, a little much to ask of a child or grandma.SummaryI'm digging it, but only because I don't need to play games on it and can tinker with it to get it to do stuff and to generally make it work.

With the apps running in the background, doesn't leave a lot of free RAM to start up a new app. Also, the Android system, at least on the Cruz, had a lot of processes running in the background when the device startsup. Also, some of the pre-installed apps start automatically when the device starts up, which leaves less RAM for apps you want to start manually.

Since it does not come with access to Google's Android store, you have to use GetJar or the Amazon marketplace.So, I went to their website, and found the download for Android 2.2. No download for Android 3 available - as for all cheap Android tablets, so no surprise. It's pretty 'simple' to upgrade: take the SD card out of the tablet, put it in your computer, download the update, copy it to the SD card, put the card back in the tablet, reboot while holding 3 buttons and wait. Not the smoothest experience, but it works.Then I tried to install apps again. Still, many simply failed after a download saying 'Application not installed'. No reason, no explanation, no hint what to do.Tried Angry Birds - the staple of Tablet apps. No dice.After some tinkering, here is what I found:(Disclaimer: Android 3 is supposedly (!) better at this, but its not available for most Tablets).The tablet has 2 GB internal storage and 4GB on the SD card. So far so good.The internal memory is divided in 1.5GB 'general' storage and 512MB application storage.What that means is, that installed applications need to fit into the 512MB. If you don't know what that means, let's just say its not a lot.But it gets better. Yes, you can find some menu to move apps then from that internal storage to the SD card, but in order to do that IT NEEDS TO INSTALL FIRST. Since Angry Birds was bigger than said 500MB (actually, mine had only 400MB free) I could not install it, to move it. *&!%^%$$!!!Some more Google searching revealed that if you download the Android SDK on your computer, you can then log into the tablet remotely and tell it to install by default to the SD card instead. So, that's what I did, and it worked. Sort of.Because now, 2hrs later, Angry Birds installed, but some other games wouldn't work. Turns out, some games don't work when installed onto the SD card, because Android does not treat all storage equally. Figures.Now, back into the settings, moving those apps from the SD card - where they now install by default - back to the internal memory. Some games still didn't work.What a mess and what a horrible experience. There is no way, the average consumer can figure this out.So, unless you know a computer guy or know what your are doing, stay away. Even then, it sucks. I suspect ALL cheap Android tablets are that way.Save up for an iPad or buy a Kindle Fire instead.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "I would've been better off burning that $250", "Author": "J.D.Knapp", "ReviewID": "RFJL57R07U95R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This thing is slow, unresponsive as hell & will not open the majority of PDF files I throw at it.

If your a savvy, high tech electronic gadgets type person then this tablet will frustrate you. As for me... I am on a budget but have been dying to get in on this new tablet craze!  For the most part this Cruz t301 while fairly outdated and basic,  does a good job when you consider the price being under 100 bucks.  It has a good clean design and a sturdy build. The biggest most annoying draw back is not being able to install a flash player ( no youtube or most other streaming video websites that require adobe flash).  Angry birds is not accessible either,  but i can live with out having those.  After working on the phone with tech support I did finally update my tablet to android 2.2.  The difference doesn't seem like a whole lot but it does help. This tablet streams videos well when you can find a site that will support it.  You have to have patience with the touchscreen too.  Sometimes you have to touch the same tab about 3-4 times before it finally registers. Other then that it has HUGE memory possibilities up to 32MB with an added SD card (I have a 8MB card and its been more then enough) and countless apps mostly from getjar.com market.  The standard e-reader is a nice touch and I already have 4 FREE books form the pre-installed amazon kindle app,  including a free bible book. Overall I think the 3 stars is right.  This lil tablet shines as a web browser but lacks the flash memory needed for streaming videos. Still... I would not consider this a waist of money as you can still get good use out of it,  however it is fairly basic when you compare it to more expensive tablets but like I said if your on a budget and want some useful/portable/affordable entertainment, just like to check your email, go on facebook or just play a few games then the Velocity Cruz t301 is for you. The thing I like most is if I'm away from my computer I can use the web browser to pay ALL my bills if I needed to as the browser works fine!  Bottom line...

Trying to CruzMarket, it'll crush also.  I did some research and found that re-flashing the firmware from Velocity site will help.  So I download to SD Card root and boot up w/ power and volume up bottom.  After new firmware it'll work going online, so that's good.Then the next problem I noticed is the headphone.  When playing video or youtube, background music or noise will be louder than speaking volume.  Some post said this is due to a short in the headphone hardware.Adding to that the overall performance of this device is slow, so the capacitive seems lagging, I decided to return this unit.  As some said don't expect a tablet, expect it as the ereader and it'll work out better.I also root this unit[...]It allows for Market app, Google Map, Google Calendar ..etc.  I haven't try using the rooted app to overclock this device, probably will speed up things.

I found it for $159 with free shipping on Amazon and although I was leaning toward the new \"mini\" nook or the upcoming Kobo e-reader, I felt that the combination of Android 2.2, a capacitive touchscreen and color display was worth a roll of the dice.As my primary goal was to have an e-reader with a touchscreen (preferably not a resistive screen) to view scanned PDFs and other e-books for school, any other functions such as wifi and multimedia were strictly ancillary.Pros:--Android 2.2 (no clear path for upgrades, although there is a minor swell of folks looking to port 2.3 to the MIPS processor in this device)--Beautiful color 800x600 display with good contrast and color tone--Wifi with G & *N* compatibility--Uses standard SD cards for expansion--Real mini USB port for charging, data transfer and ADB support--Separate charging port for fast charger--Well finished, with nice overall look (I own an original Motorola \"Droid\" phone and like some heft and \"industrial\" feel to my devices)--Rubberize paint on back of case has nice feel and is easy to grip--CHEAPCons:--A little sluggish at times--Touchscreen can be wonky, but I think that's mostly because it's a little weak processor-wise--Display could be a little brighter--Volume from built-in speakers is weak--MIPS based chipset, so many apps don't install correctly. However, this seems to be a developer issue, as many of the well-review apps work fine.--Wireless range seems to be a bit lacking, but certainly workable in a normal home or workplace--Gloss screen can be taxing to use in bright light/sun--Did not come with an SD card, but who doesn't have a handful of these laying around unused anyway?Conclusion:If you understand the limitations of this device, it's a great compromise for what little it costs. Android 2.2 is getting a little long in tooth, but there's some hope that 2.3 might get ported to the platform (and probably will if these less expensive devices sell well). If you are looking for an e-reader that you can use in direct sunlight or under strong overhead lights with no glare, this is not the right device for you.

I normally research expensive purchases before making them...especially for brands or products i'm not familiar with.  It's important to know that this item had the potential to be exactly what I was looking for.  I originally wanted an iPad.  But decided that I would be wasting my money since I already own an iPhone and MacBook Pro.  So I decided that a more affordable eReader was what I wanted.  However, the Kindle with it's black and white display and less than simple button features were a turnoff.  I wanted a product that was full color, and was touch. After reading mixed reviews on this product I figured that I knew what I was getting myself into with some of the \"cons\" of this product.  I knew that a $199 price tag was not going to get me  \"a cheap iPad\" but I did expect to get what was advertised. And I did not.  Straight out of the box the device would not power up.  I referred to the \"start up guide\" (a four page spread and the only documentation included spare the warranty) and it said nothing about charging it before use ect, I referred to the internet (on my laptop) to the online manual...which still included no trouble shooting or start up information.  I referred to an online blog written by some other poor sap like myself that wasted money on this paperweight.  They suggested resetting the device...and wala it powered up.  I set up the wireless connection with no issue and after setting up my Kindle & Facebook apps (already installed)  they worked well.  But after powering the device down (so that it could fully charge as is it arrived to me with no battery), and attempting to power it back up it was then stuck on the android load screen and cannot be reset.Some people have had success with this device and love it, and I am not sure weather I received a defective item or if this product needs some work.*Update: I returned this item to Amazon, and I must commend them on their STELLAR customer service!  The item (with provided return ship label) took only a few days to reach them, and are already issuing my refund.  This renews my faith in purchasing expensive items online.

I want 4:3 and capacitive touch screen for viewing Bible and music sheets, and the normal web stuff. But iPad costs too much. Cruz T301 seems to be the only product that meet my criteria.The good:A solid product. The screen is bright and beautiful, with very good viewing angle both vertically and horizontally. The capacitive screen works well, typing is effortless. Battery life is good. Most, but not all, applications that I care for do run on it. I'm especially happy to see Weather & Toggle Widgets run on it. So does Evernote, Dropbox, Googlemap (no GPS, but great for checking traffic). WIFI works well, connects and reconnects quickly.The not so good:First impression is that it's noticeably heavier then Kindle. But I got used to it after a while. Second thing I noticed is that the processor is slow. I need to swipe slowly, and expect a little lag for the tablet to respond at times. It takes some practice to avoid registering a 'press' when I really wanted to swipe. The 7\" screen is much bigger then other 'narrow' 7\" tablets, but still too small for music sheets. Lacking the scroll button causes some problems with some apps, such as going to the next chapter of the Bible.Suggestions:A task killer seems to help with the performance. Although Android experts don't think task killers are useful, but some tasks do run in the background and take up bandwidth. And the T301 needs every clock cycle it can get. Hopefully the next firmware release can improve on this.Freewarelovers.com does have a good collection of apps in installable .apk format. I also ran Astro on my Android phone and backed-up all the applications on the micro SD card as .apk files, then transferred the files to the Cruz via the SD card, and ran Astro on Cruz to install all the apps. Astro saved me a lot of time.Conclusion:For older people who don't have good eye sight, don't care for games, the T301's screen is big enough for reading and access the net, and quite portable.

On the plus side, it has a USB port and an SD card slot for importing files.BUT...You can't download typical apps. Forget Angry Birds. Forget YouTube. You have to use the Facebook mobile site. YouTube's webpage wouldn't load. I was able to get Gmail, but that's not exactly something I'd pay $99 for. We thought we might upgrade to Android 2.2 but the hardware under the hood still prevented the aforementioned issues. While I expected no Android Market, the Cruz Market was awful. So not much in the game department. We then got the idea that it might be a good media player- I loaded the regular SD card on, connected the USB to my computer to transfer MP3 files, and the thing then promptly crashed.Now here's the thing: If you are going to be a paperweight that lights up, at least light up. So we had to re-set the thing and *maybe* it will be an OK media player with the SD card I supplied. Please bear in mind that we didn't just open this on Christmas, we've been tinkering with the thing since Black Friday so it would be ready out of the Box after Santa visited.

WiFi, Email & games are pretty painless to set up. I've been able to find free WiFi in lots of places even in the burbs. Many apps require some trial and error. The Kindle and Borders apps are useless if you have your own books (free from many torrents)and only work with books you buy from their website. Cruz recommends Wordplayer but I found it to be unstable and with a poor format that was hard to read or customize. For reading Aldiko works great but you have to use the older version for Android 2.0 or earlier. The built-in Browser works well, also tried Dolphin which was a little easier to use. Battery life seems to be ok especially if you shut off wifi when not using. Battery will charge while usb is connected, or so it claims. I never left it connected long enough to test it. Had a little trouble connecting to PC at first. Didn't realize you had to click on usb icon on cruz and \"mount\" the SD card. Wasted lots of time trying to find WinXP drivers that aren't needed. Once you figure it out, file transfer is a breeze. I tried the CruzSync/ZumoDrive app that comes with it. It allows access to files stored offsite kind of like FTP. I had trouble transfering files from Zumodrive physically to the card. Acessing them via WiFi wastes power and has lots of transfer errors for realime things like music play.

I thought this tablet was made by engineers, did they have only a grocery store calculator?! It doesn't have a dictionary installed. I tried installing \"borders\" app, it didn't work.Updating firmware? This tablet even said it can't find the update files that were supposed to be in the included SD card. When I check out the SD card in my real HP computer, the SD Card contained folders that had nothing on it!My impression is that this tablet is not cool, it is just a business hype, luring people people who want to save money. I wanted something that I can use both in my work and entertainment perhaps, but doesn't cost a lot of my hard-earned dollars.I have to return it right away, rather than get madder and just smash this brick thing against the wall.In conclusion, this Cruz tablet is not even worth its low-cost now of 200 dollars. What is a low-cost product if you can't even use it? If you can't use something, and it cost you a dollar, then it is actually expensive, because you waste your money.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "a very decent 3-star device, but that's all I wanted!", "Author": "atlantic1 \"atlantic1\"", "ReviewID": "R92GJV1YWWQLR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have seen many people showing off their Ipads, and frankly I couldn't understand what the big deal was. All I wanted was a portable device (for my wife) so that she wouldn't be stuck in front of the PC monitor all day surfing the Internet and checking e-mail. This device is not for serious work, it is not for work at all, actually, but like other people have said before me, it is very useful for simple/mobile tasks (checking websites/e-mail while on the go, or when you don't feel like waiting for the PC to boot up - this little device turns on and connects to the Internet in just seconds, provided it has a router to connect to, obviously). The only minor gripe I have has to do with the touch response, the screen seems to be fairly responsive by itself, but sometimes it takes a while for the command to be recognized by the system, so navigation can be rather slow at times. Also, I would have liked to have a microphone input so that we could use it with Skype for telephone calls on the Internet, but for this price (around $150 as of November 2011) I am pretty happy with it as it is. Also, it doesn't have a camera, either, again, that is OK for what we wanted. On the plus side, it DOES have a slot for an SD card, and it DOES have a mini-USB input, which makes transferring files very easy (Ipad doesn't have either of them, and that was one of the reasons I did not want an Ipad, I'll let the geeks jump through their own hoops to transfer files).

They took no steps to expedite the delivery but rather I had to wait a week shipping each way to get it back.  When they sent it back to me, they apparently had loaded on Windows 8 from another CD rather than the OEM version so I could not activate the product.  I literally called 8 times to try to straighten this out before they finally got me a new product key.  In the interim, they made me call back several times, call Microsoft to try to work it out, and send them various pictures.  This process began in February and only was finally resolved in May!  I found the customer service people to be generally unhelpful, rude, and not at all taking ownership of their product.

There is a Cruz Marketplace, but it's pretty empty and not maintained. For example, in the Games category, there are three games available.The Cruz website says the T301 \"Play games and install custom Android apps. Install Android applications from the Amazon Appstore for Android\"This is a part truth. 90% of the games or apps I try to install error with \"Application Not Installed\" at the end of the install. No specific reason. I looked it up, and this is because Cruz comes with a custom version of Froyo that doesn't work with a lot of applications.  The only thing you can do is try a different app. It's too bad Cruz didn't have a way to tell what apps are supported before wasting download time.However, like I said, if you want to read an e-book, this will work fine.

Immediately, however, it began to disappoint. First, it's really thick!  Also First:  this is not a multi-touch tablet. My bad, I should have caught that when I ordered it. I should not have assumed.Second, the keypad touchscreen interface is very, very awkward. Missed letters and slow response make typing painful and error-prone.Third, the UI is downright ugly. It really looks like my experimental Linux desktop after I spent hours getting it installed and running 8 years ago - sparse and clunky. Just a couple of apps.Fourth: The browser is really a dog. It reminds me of the browser my Nokia clamshell phone had in 2004. To zoom in, you double-touch. To zoom out - same. That's it. No variable scaling. Did I mention there is no multi-touch? OK, getting over it.How about I play one of the tens of thousands of games on the android market? Ummm, let's see, where's that Android Market app? Sorry - no Android Market. There is the Cruz Market, though, so that's gotta have the same apps I like, right? Nope. In fairness, I didn't search for Czech HangMan, just those Angry Birds, which were nowhere to be found.Other problem: The touchscreen started randomizing the calibration points. Once that happened, the unit wouldn't even unlock, as I had to guess where to touch the screen. That required a system reset, but in the meantime provided a modicum of entertainment.It's an unfair comparison, given the 2.5x cost difference, but I was given an iPad this Christmas, and while the roads on the Apple-only Turnpike I'm forced to drive on collect frequent tolls, at least the roads are paved. That iPad personal entertainment device sure does handle nicely.So I prepare for return my sad Cruz Tablet with all the technological flash of a pre-gladsnost Moscow taxi, with its lonley sparse desktop and nowhere to get decent apps.

That's what this feels like. Trying to run Linux on a 486 computer with a 400 MB hard drive. Maybe this is being too technical, but that's what I felt I was doing with this product.Not that Linux is bad, cause it isn't, but there are some things that it won't do as well as Windows and this thing definitely has its limitations.The reference to the 400 MB hard drives is that once you install a small version of Linux on your machine, you don't have much space to install very much else if you plan on customizing the applications you have running on your computer. This thing comes with a 4 gig micro sd card but it doesn't help you if you plan on installing many apps. You quickly run out of space being that this only installs apps to the dedicated system memory. Which at this moment, I cannot recall how big that is. But it's not much. I tried to install an android game of 17 megabytes that was downloaded to the sd card. Could not install it. Would not install it. And that's with only maybe 4 other apps that I had installed. A couple of browsers and some readers apps. The browsers are necessary if you plan on watching any youtube. And good luck on finding those without having any direct access to the android market. Took me forever to find them.On giving credit to Linux for it's capabilities, it is a good operating system. But whenever I've used it, it wasn't for much more then for surfing. Which is about all this item is good for. It would not open or view PDF files very well. The PDF software that everyone mentions on the reviews is for purchase only and only on the android market, which I could not get to because this is Android 2.0.So, to conclude; This is an old android 2.0 box trying to live in and android 2.2 world. It won't do much very well, but it will do somethings ok. If you can live with limited software apps you can install and having to uninstall constantly because of space issues, then you will be okay with this. Keep in mind, the media player is very basic. I did not like it myself. As a reader. It will do. But don't try to open too many PDF files with it.

The resolution is good enough for reading books. I even bought a book to use on the Kindle app, the 1977 NASB, to be exact. It works as advertised. Since I paid less than $90 for my tablet (not counting postage) I was ahead of the game when it came to that. Another important app that I installed works for a well, called And-Bible. I downloaded this from the freewarelovers site. It worked quite well. The only thing that didn't work was the text-to-speech function, which I really don't need.The installed apps for the T301, all seem to work, well most is I tried anyway. With Froyo OS installed, things were quite smoothly. Using the Skyfire browser, I even could look at a limited amount of Flash files. It works quite well on YouTube videos. You can load your own videos, still pictures, and audio MP3 files, and have a good device to handle those as well.Now, after all these compliments, you might wonder why only gave it a \"good\" rating? First of all, it will often jump out of a very long webpage--no matter what browser I'm using--or perhaps a page that has some video content that upsets it? This can be irksome, to say the least. It almost always handles mobile webpages and short standard webpages  well.  I found out, apparently, what was causing the problem, JavaScript.  It is very easy to turn off in the included browser. Resets caused by certain webpages seems to have been eliminated.Now, this tablet is doing most everything I want. I do want remote control of at least one of my home computers. This actually might be done, I got it to control a netbook on my home Wi-Fi. I used AndroidVNC (at the freewarelovers site) and TightVNC on the Windows machine. However, this may wipe out the Fancy Widget and clear your screen of that particular clock and weather forecasting widget. However, for me this is not a big deal. Setting up TightVNC on a Windows machine is a pain in the neck, though. No, Teamviewer will not work on this tablet. Probably the other major frustration of this tablet is not what doesn't work at all but partly works, such as AndroidVNC which apparently works with the aforementioned consequences as does App2sdpro.apk. You can get App2sdpro to work, actually quite well for programs, which can be moved, but it seems to either erase or not transfer material such as bookmarks for browsers. This is could be a serious nuisance for some people.  Considering there are few apps that I want to run on this tablet; I can keep everything I want just on the flash memory of the tablet. But, I would have hoped that apps could be transferred smoothly from flash to SD card.There are of course apps that don't run on it, but also quite a few that do. Just be aware so when experimenting you might get some surprising and unpleasant results. Unless you consider this  as a learning experience for you, and that is what in part I look upon it as, for Android devices.

As soon as I plugged it in it the battery said that it was at 45% - realised there was a battery issue packed it back up for return.Cruz ereader #2 - Returned original ereader to BestBuy and drove to the only other store in my city that had the replacement. Took replacement home started playing with it and guess what? Yep the battery started failing almost immediately.Cruz ereader #3 - Having returned #2 to BestBuy hit up Borders and decided to give it one last shot and yes I hit three in a row.Three units of the same model from two different retailers within 72 hours suggests to me that they have something of a problem with this product.Am returning #3 tomorrow and am ready to finally accept that this can't and doesn't do what it says it will.

Fine, 2.2 (it comes with upgrade instructions to get you to 2.2) is new enough for app compatibility.The major problem here is the kind of CPU this thing has. It uses a MIPS architecture, rather than ARM. These are different kinds of CPU that computers can have, for the less geeky readers. This comes up when you try to install apps from the Amazon marketplace. Any app which uses native code (specially optimized bits of the program to speed things up) won't install on this, because it has the wrong kind of CPU.No angry birds.No fruit ninja.No netflix.No recent flash support.I couldn't even get a simple wordfind app to install.Ugh.The worst part of it is everything looks on the up-and-up until the very last second of installing an app. You can install Amazon App Store just fine. You can download the app. You can begin to install the app. After churning for a little bit, it quits with an \"Application Not Installed\" error. That's it. No clue what to do. If you're not an android hacker what the heck are you supposed to do? How would you know what's going wrong?My kids certainly didn't.

It's not a perfect device, but it's really good for the amount i paid.First up - I've been looking for a tablet to watch my movies without bringing my Macbook along. I'm a real TV/Movie buff, and i have tonnes to catch up on. That's a huge reason why i didn't want to get the iPad; It's expensive, required tiresome video conversion, and i thought it was too heavy after playing with it in the stores.The Good:- Supported movie formats are more than what i need: Most of mine are in the usual .avi formats, and i used to spend about 6 minutes on each episode using Mac's iSquint to convert them into accepted .mp4 formats. With this tablet, all i need to do is to just drag and drop it. Everything just works and plays great.- MicroSD Card Slot: I have a 32GB MicroSD to go along with the 8GB Zii O. It's really convenient because 32GB can hold alot of videos and music, and the tablet allows direct playback from the microSD. You don't need to copy it to the on-board memory in order for it to work.- Apps: Here's a key point - You'll need to go into Settings > Apps to allow installation for non-Android Market Applications. It wasn't enabled by default. Once you enable this, just google around for Android installation files (.apk) and you'll be able to install stuff smoothly. So far, i've installed Evernote and Kindle; Everything syncs and works perfectly.Some of you may have concerns about there not being support for the Android Marketplace. It wasn't that big of a deal for me because a friend pointed me to getjar.com, and there was a whole lot of .apk files to download. Just use the Zii O browser to access the site, download, and they'll prompt you for installation. No need to use your computer at all. (If getjar prompts you to select your device, just select any mobile device. It'll work fine.)- This may be controversial, but i like the resistive screen. It's not fancy like those capacitive touch, but it works with my gloves on, and even better with the provided stylus, so i'm happy about it.- Other stuff i like: Audio quality is really good. HDMI TV-Out to my 42-inch screen works, though the video looks a little pixelated, something to blame on my original source file.Things Which Can Be Improved:- No Android Marketplace integration. (A small issue, but solvable through my above-mentioned point)- A little stingy on the package contents; I appreciate the stylus, but would have been nice to include a pair of earphones, or even the TV Out cable.- There are 4 touch-buttons at the bottom for easy access to \"Home\", \"Back\" etc buttons. They should be backlit so that i can see more clearly in the dark.---I hope i've provided everyone with an objective pro/cons list. Personally, i like it, and i think it's great for anyone who's looking for a low-cost tablet which just works.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly surprised!", "Author": "John Clu", "ReviewID": "RRM1EOK91DNXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this as a gift and spent a few days with it. I do own an iPad.Pros- My media files do not need to be processed by iTunes, I can just drag and drop to the ZiiO after it was recognized by my PC as a USB drive.- I can play all the video files I loaded to it, even up to 1080p trailers, play it back on the HDMI on my large LCD TV and it looks great.- The player is much lighter than the iPad.- The micro SD card slot is very convenient, after loading it with media from my PC, pop it in and had no problem browsing through the files.Cons- Resistive touch. I got used to it, it was not that bad.- Display is not as good as iPad. But then given that the unit is about half of what an iPad sells for, it is very usable.- Android 2.1 only, I expect they will offer an upgrade to Android 2.2 in the future.Ran the Quadrant benchmark and got a score of 2037!

Probably will return it or put in on eBay as it is not such a big improvement over the first gen iPAD._____________________________Updated: Sept 22, 2011Looks like Creative finally posted a new firmware (2.00.14) and the accelerated Flash Player to go with it.

The marketplace allows you to download seamlessly. Download the Dolphin Browser-it makes the browsing a hundred times faster and never stutters unlike the built in browser. I think you may also be able to get that browser through the Ziio marketplace too but that is a pain to use and sign up for. 90% of apps work that are free in Android PIT-some do not. That is not a Ziio prob. Any Android tablet that is not recognized as a phone/has a data plan via Android Google Marketplace has this problem. That is also why no weather apps ever work on the Ziio, since these seem to require a data plan of some kind. Anyway, any Android device that is not officially recognized by Google as an official Android device will have these problems. If you buy an app that does not work and remove it from your device within a few minutes you get a refund immediately-but make sure you keep internet connectivity on. I still have not figured out how long you have to try before it won't give a refund-though I could look it up. The other marketplace is [...]-in the Android section of course-that is the marketplace which Ziio uses in its marketplace, but i would download directly: you click on the download link for any app and then a page comes up with(supposedly) the download, but it doesn't, so you have to click on the link that says if the download has not begun, click here. Then everything is straightforward. I think either the Kindle or the Nook apps are in one of these sites but i got mine from [...] will find that in some cases the app will fail to download. Try 2 or three times-always until a successful download occurs. Half of all my apps(i have 30) had this problem but now work perfectly. The weather apps-never-and can make your device unstable. I learned the hard way. The Kindle and Nook apps work great, as does BBC. Time, World Newspapers, US Newspapers. I will post a full list one of these days. That's all i have time for now. I hope this helps some of you.You MAY possibly find that if your Ziio becomes slow and unresponsive that you need to do a factory reset(big clue is that the device will not recognize the official charger and will not charge-luckily I had another charger from another device that worked-odd really. But a factory reset would probably have solved that problem but not if you do not have enough power left or a second charger). I had installed a dozen apps and that was the case. I advise all users to fully charge the device out of the box. Do a factory reset and then follow the steps above. My device now works better than the iPad i sold last year. No crappy iTunes and hundreds of useless apps to drain my device and it is very comfortable and light in my hands. Easy to download almost any kind of music/video file that is non apple purchased. So rip your own dvds/cds and have at it.This is not a device for non techies. I write reviews and test these kind of products almost every week. One of these days there will be an android device that IS recognized by the Google Marketplace, without being a phone/requiring a data plan, that does not cost a fortune. Until that day, for me anyway, the Ziio is the best alternative, but needs a lot of customizing. For web browsing and Kindle/Nook replacement alone is worth the price-heck, you get  a backlit Kindle device!! LOL.

But having a budget in mind, I couldn't afford the Ipad, so Creative ziio it is. It seemed to be a good choice as it's relatively affordable and suits my budget.What I like/enjoy:1. Sound quality: The speakers are loud - useful when sharing music or videos with my friends. Sometimes I just play music directly from it while I'm home. I like it :)2. Lightweight: Given that we girls don't really enjoy carrying too much bulk around, this fits nicely into my handbag, even with the leather case on. And it's not heavy at all. Feels just like a book in my hand.3. Screen: I am not sure if the touchscreen seems to be a trouble, but it doesn't cause me much hassle. My boyfriend owns an Ipad and I notice the differences in the touch experience. With ziio though, I find that the screen responds quickly to the provided stylus. Sometimes I even use my fingernails, which works as well - something which i cannot do on the Ipad. The screen is also really bright and all i have to do is to drag the videos into the ziio folder and viola it plays!4.  Store for apps: It has a store that recommends apps, which I can browse, download and install. It's quite easy to use :)What I dislike:1. Front camera - I feel that the front camera could be better, because the current quality is average.2. No 3G - May not be convenient while commuting. I heard there are some ways to hook up your handphone's 3G to the ziio but i have yet to try that out.

Depending on what you're looking for in a tablet, this may (or may not) be the right one for you.It does a fantastic (10/10) job at playing a huge variety of media file formats without a hitch.  It plays divx, xvid, mkv (some mkv files play without sound, unfortunately), and more.  It even supports video formats that my wife's Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1\" is unable to play.  Also, does great with mp3 and other sound files.  So, if you're looking for a straight up media player, and nothing more, this is the gadget for you.  It also has a mini hdmi-out jack (no cable included), for viewing your media files on TV.However, it doesn't excel at anything else.  Not being able to download apps from the app store is, of course, a huge drawback.  In addition, the browser is pretty awful because it lacks its own \"BACK\" button.  Often, when you hit the permanent back arrow below the screen, it will minimize the browser instead of taking you back to the last page viewed.  It's absolutely necessary to install another browser, especially if you want to view pages like facebook, which is basically unviewable from the built-in browser.  Also, for some reason, you cannot view youtube in full screen mode -- I can't figure that one out.The speed of the device isn't great, either.  There tends to be a (very slight) lag when you switch from one application to another.  Many apps don't work on the device because of the lack of system resources or other compatibility issues.  It is also absolutely essential to install adobe flash -- which is hard to do when you can't download it from an app store (and for some reason, it will not install from adobe's website!).  One final nitpick, if you want to use your own headphone/mic combo cord, no dice -- you can only use the built-in mic.The way I see it, this is a solid media player that also lets you surf the internet (although it doesn't do a great job of it).", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another winner for Creative", "Author": "M.B.", "ReviewID": "RH44RXSWCPZMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Creative fan since I bought my first MP3 player a few years ago.  Since then I have bought everyone in the family one.  Creative builds quality products that is comparable to any on the market.  With that I will give you my thoughts on the ZiiO.This was my first Android product I have ever used and I can tell you it is a excellent tablet especially for the price. It is very easy to drag and drop music and video files without converting anything.  The ZiiO accepts a wide array of different audio/video formats.  I wanted a tablet that was more useful than an IPOD touch for movies, e-books, web surfing etc.  Granted it will not fit in your pocket but it is no bigger than an steno pad.  Some people complained about the resistive touch screen but I find the IPAD touch screen to be twitchy. This is a total non-issue.  I think the tablets speed and performance are up to date with the industry standards in this price range.The audio quality is where Creative made its money in the past and they incorporated that into the new ZiiO.  The internal speakers are probably the best on the market.  With the bluetooth feature you can stream music to speakers or headphones.Those that wanted to wait for Android 2.2 the wait is over.  As of March 25 you can download the 2.2 firmware to your ZiiO.  My ZiiO came in the mail the same day and I updated to 2.2 right away so I cannot tell you what 2.1 system was like.  The standard web browser on 2.2 is very good.  I don't know if I will even put another browser on it or not.  It is that good.I really wanted the Kindle App but I had trouble downloading it on the ZiiO.  So after upgrading to 2.2 I looked at my apps and low and behold there was the Kindle app.  It must have been bundled with the new 2.2 operating system.  I had no indication that any of my attempts to download Kindle had worked.  After that I was a happy camper.  I was looking at a Kindle but wanted something that did more than read for only 100.00 bucks more.  The e-book reader on ZiiO is fine I just do a lot of business on Amazon so it was an obvious choice for me.  Of course its about 6 oz heavier than a kindle but that is still about 8 oz lighter than an IPAD.  I have not read outside in the sun yet but i can read at night in bed without having a book light on.  You can black out the screen and have white letters.  My wife likes that.  If I want to read on the beach I guess I will go old school.My only complaint is I wanted a 16 GB version but there were none available when I made the purchase.  I now see that they are available again.  My advice would be to buy the 16 GB version.  A 16 GB SD card will cost you about 25 anyways.In conclusion I would say if you are looking for a low price tablet that works very well this is the one for you.  I bought a netbook and this tablet for the price of the IPAD.  Lets be real, the IPAD, ZiiO and the other tablets are mostly for entertainment purposes.

Here are my pro's;Pros- Great price compared to other tablets- Bundled apps (Music, Video, epub reader, etc) are actually quite good.- Fast CPU, tasks are very snappy- Long battery life - I can watch about 6 hours of video before a recharge, many many hours of music- Bluetooth is low latency.  You can watch a video with bluetooth headphones and it will be in sync.- X-fi crystalizer works & makes your music sound better.  Not the gimmick I thought it would be.- Video playback is high quality - plays everything I've thrown at it without any problems and you can hook it up to a TV over HDMI- microSD slot is niceCons- There should be a slot for the stylus in the device- The touch buttons on the bottom are hard to find in the dark- No android market.  Most Google apps work (maps, earth, navigation), but a few don't (reader).- Consider the camera a bonus.

I am also interested in ebook readers. Thirdly, price, the iPad attracts me but is priced as much as a very good netbook computer that can do as much (and more) than an iPad.The Ziio is a good video player with excellent sound and an adequate sized screen for VGA resolution. I find the touch screen responsive and precise. Had I not read that it is \"older\" resistive technology I would not have noticed because it works and it works well. Navigation is easy and it is easy to add Android apps.Wireless communications is supported better than many higher priced tablets. Another feature that I appreciate is the multitude of audio and video files type that are supported without a slow and messy conversion software. As for ebook reader, you can get an app to read pdf files and the result is better than the 6\" Amazon kindle (I own one) and with a free app you can import books designed for the kindle and have a good reader (in color). I give Kindle the edge because I like the daylight e-ink reading ability and the Kindle has far longer battery life. Another advantage the Kindle has is its weight, the ziio weighs almost as much as the iPad whereas the Kindle is much lighter and less tiresome to hold. I would tolerate the heavier ziio for a hundred dollars more than the Kindle because you get many other entertainment and productivity options. Ziio has a good free hand pen pad that lets you take notes freehand. With a camera and video support with an accelerometer to keep you pointed up.I like the ziio and it appears to be a sturdy and well made product with plenty of Android apps (many free) on Creative's web site.

I really enjoy the flexibility of the tablet.It is great for browsing the web (despite the lack of Flash support), watching videos which are transferred to the device, composing emails, and many other things.Most would say the Ziio fails in the lack of apps available, however; with a Google search and a little persistence I have found quite a few apps including YouTube, Facebook, eBaY, Amazon, and even Angry Birds.The installed Android is only version 2.1 so it is a bit archaic in that sense but Creative has stated that a 2.2 update is in the works and will be released soon.

When I first received it (it was shipped within 2 days even though I chose Super Saver Shipping which was a huge plus)it gave a bad first impression, it loaded up fine but it started to freeze and it even rebooted on its own once and was stuck on the Zii Powered logo screen, and I thought to myself, I'm going to return thisthe next day, but I decided to give it a second chance and it payed off and is working like a champ. The #1 reason I purchased this was to replace \"most\" of my papers for taking notes in class, the built in handwriting recognition is utterly horrible when replaced with WritePad (handwriting recognition app), it improves substantially, as it recognizes almost ANY type of handwriting, even in cursive provided that it somewhat resembles the letter or word. With that it makes handwriting much more easier, and with a resistive screen precision is flawless since the stylus has a relatively fine tip compared to the capacitive screen stylus' (horrible). Another problem I faced was the lack of apps availability, the ziio store didnt have too much to offer so I was thinking to myself howto get the Google Market and apps on it. Looked around a lot and many said it was not possible including some youtube videos, but I came along a certain developers site that actually succeeded in not only installing the Market but also rooting it and installing a proper Busybox (ignore thisif you don't know what I'm talking about :p ). Like I said this tablet is much better for tecnically knowledged people because it even took me awhile to figure howto properly use and edit the files for rooting.  Once rooted the tablet becomes just as capable as any $400+ tablet.  FLASH does work on this and just like any tablet some sites work well and others not so well, on youtube it plays everything upto 480p smoothly, anything higher (720p & 1080p) stutters.  Locally stored HD videos play perfectly (not many tablets can play 1080p videos well like this one does).PROS:-Flash support-handwriting recognition (with writepad) with fine tip stylus-HD video playback-X-FI audio (quality is much better than anything i heard)-Good performance (scored 2200+ on quadrant)-Good apps install after google market installationCons:-requires tecnical knowledge and guts to get the most out of it-resistive screen (im growing to like it though)-no multitouch support-only froyo now would like atleast gingerbread if not honeycomb-does not charge through usbAlso for people who says no 3g support, i got news for you, you can pair this with your phone to use its 3g or even 4g connection on the go (after modifiying a system file).I will post a video review when i get a chance.Enjoy your tablet and sorry to those that couldnt enjoy it like I am.PS wrote this whole review from my tablet with handwriting only.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Creative ZiiO 16GB", "Author": "M.

As an ereader it is easier for her to see the text than a 7\" screen would, and for Angry Birds it's hilarious how well she can play it on this tablet over, say, her phone.The bad - I thought ALL Android products came with the Android Market.  This does not - and it turns out, a lot of tablets don't.The considerations - This tablet uses a resistive touch screen, so it can't do the two-finger \"pinch\" movements.  My wife has some digital difficulty due to microstrokes, so that's good for her.  It also requires a bit more pressure than the capactive screens do, again that's good for her.  Others may find this irritating or make it almost unusable - be forewarned about this (again, for us, this made it a better choice.)Contrast is excellent on it.  The buttons on the border, however (home, menu, back, etc.) are hard to see at times, due to the lack of contrast.Battery life, as always, could be better.  Until they're powered by quark spin, however, you will ALWAYS hear that.  She can read a book for up to six hours without any problem - and on a fresh charge, she can play Angry Birds for over three hours.  Or Solitaire or Mahjong for three hours.  I call that acceptable.  Your mileage may vary.  I don't know how long the battery will last running videos, we don't on this unit.It can play Flash videos, but it can't run the Flash games on Facebook.

Those familiar with Creative may know how global they are with simply the best universal kits available.  I have a couple of high-end Creative media players and have the universal adapter I can swap between any of them whilst on other continents.  For the Ziio it comes ready to exchange plugs with any other continent, will be perfect with the universal.Secondly it comes with a HDMI cable included.  I have a way more expensive Toshiba Thrive that didn't come with a bloody thing!Thirdly a fantastic stylus, again not free with the Thrive.  It's very responsive.The curved sides really make for easy grip, wasn't expecting it to feel this good in the hands.The sound is also as you'd expect from a Creative Product, absolutely great.The only negative is not having Play Store availability but most users should easily be able to have the know-how of where to find the apps they need else where with a little effort.For so little money I don't see how one could complain.  Judging it side-by-side with the Thive that's 3x as expensive its hard to justify that percentage of extra cost.

It is not the easiest to find the apps from the android market as others have stated but with a little time it is possible to get them, and ALL android tablets in this small price range will not include access to the android market so it is not a flaw from Creative. Overall I am pleased with the purchase because it seems to be priced just right as the brand is better than the cheap others you will see out there. It is not this super powerful device that does amazing things so do not expect that. I use it to surf the internet which is faster than I expected and download a few files such as powerpoints or documents, listen to music, and just play apps on it. Also, the resistive touch screen has worked great for me it is not a hassle as some may think.The only Cons I have found and why I give 4 stars:The screen resolution is not the greatest out there but gets the job done. For some reason the enter button and another button on the keyboard are in Chinese. It has frozen a few times so I have to restart it but works fine after that.

Due to its unreliable nature, I really only use it for listening to music and reading the news.  I can't recommend this unit as an every day tablet, because it is slow and you really have to dig through the internet sometimes to find an app you are looking for.  Browsing the internet is fine as long as you keep it brief and don't expect a typical experience.  This device freezes almost daily,  which is extremely frustrating, and the browser frequently closes at random and erases your session.  I also had to update the firmware and go out and find a flash installation in order to have an acceptable browsing experience.The resolution isn't bad but it isn't good.  The resistive touch screen works better than I had anticipated.  The X-Fi audio quality is outstanding, and is the single reason I am holding on to this tablet.  The picture quality from the camera isn't anything to write home about.  I like that it comes equipped with a file explorer and task manager.  I wish the buttons (home, back, search, play, etc) lit up, it is difficult to use this tablet in a dim room.  Overall you get what you pay for.

I was ok with the idea that this is a not-so-great product, but since in this price range I only had to choose between BN Nook Color, a few chinese gadgets and this, I chose to buy the Creative Ziio because of the specifications (why pay $170 for BN Nook Color for a lower battery power, only 800 MHz instead of 1GHz and without the ability of watching movies on it - mp4 format really doesn't count).I think people who give a negative review actually really wanted to buy an Ipad, but from different reasons they ended up with Ziio.

Lee Zimmerman \"Trekscribbler (NCC1205)\"", "ReviewID": "R15OGEXNYEQL7L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a long history with Creative products, all the way back to the Creative Nomad (if you can believe!), so I was excited when Creative debuted this tablet, but, as a consumer, I've always been skeptical about any product's advertised strengths ... so I waited a while to pick one of these up.  I did so about two months ago, and I've been testing it off and on ever since ... and I have to confess some serious disappointments with the Creative ZiiO mostly because it, simply, doesn't perform in the way Creative claims it performs.  For the record, I have been in contact with Creative, and I have been assured that they are aware of these shortcomings and are attempting to address them with firmware updates.As any serious user of contemporary electronics will tell you, memory accessibility is of critical importance.  Creative advertises that the ZiiO is available in both 8GB and 16GB models with expandable memory up to 32GB (microSD chips).  Out of the box, the unit only has 12GB available; and that's not a tremendous setback since any user is going to be aware that the device requires some internal memory for operations.  Subsequent to the purchase, I then purchased three microSD cards: an 8GB, a 16GB, and a 32GB ... and this is where Creative's troubles begin.The only card that works universally upon use is the 8GB.  The 16GB and the 32GB cards will only function properly the first time you've loaded material onto them via the tablet's interface with your PC; however, once you power down your ZiiO for whatever reason, the unit no longer recognizes the media you've loaded onto either of these cards.  You have to blank the card and reload all of the media all over again; but, once again, once you power down, rest assured that the ZiiO will not locate your materials once you've powered down.  As stated, the only card that doesn't suffer this \"lack of recognition\" is the 8GB card.I immediately communicated this error to Creative's technicians, and, as is customary for any tech, the user is first instructed to \"power down the unit and start all over.\"  However, the data never returns to the ZiiO's video cache for viewing.  It simply vanishes into nothingness.  I was then told by a different technician that Creative only tests their product's compatability with MicroSans and Transcend storage cards and that it was highly likely that other manufacturers cards would not work with the product.  I explained that all cards were MicroSans cards, and that silenced this technician.  Then, I received a third email from a Creative representative who assured me that Creative WAS AWARE of this programming deficiency and technicians were trying to address it with a new firmware update; however, as I've checked Creative's website this morning (two months later), no firmware update has been forthcoming.Consequently, I've rated the ZiiO an average product (3.0 on Amazon's scale).  This is not to say it's exceptional because, if it were, then it would perform AS ADVERTISED out of the box.  It doesn't, nor can I assume that it will in the foreseeable future.  What this means, in the short term, is that, if you're looking for available memory, you're likely not going to get it with the ZiiO.  It's still a good product (the reason for the average ranking); it's just a huge disappointment from this longtime Creative consumer who expected better.Consider yourself warned.  Creative IS NOT a service-friendly organization.  It's nearly impossible to contact them regarding technical issues, but it can happen, and you may receive a response (as I've done).  Hopefully, the company will inevitably get its act together and provide the marketplace with a suitable alternative to other, more mainstream tablets; this ZiiO just isn't quite there.UPDATE (03/27/2012): Not even a year later, and this thing completely stopped working.  It will not power on.  I've consulted the good folks at Creative, and, despite having learned in three separate emails from them that they'd furnish me with a Returns Authorization Request after utilizing their website, I've still yet to receive any documentation from them.  So not only is the product a bloated piece of junk, you may as well realize that the manufacturer is in absolutely no hurry to service it once it wickers out on you.  \"Buyer beware\" is absolutely right.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Creative ZiiO 10-inch Tablet", "Author": "JAM64", "ReviewID": "R1W27SG15WCN74", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Priced right!Needs easy link to Android market for apps.Touch key don't light up.Have two for kids and they are TOUGH!

So, when I found the ZiiO tablet on Creative's website, I read more about it.  With the recent price drop, along with it's having Android 2.2 installed, I figured it was time to give it a try.  Also, my needs are limited, since I planned to use it at my office to work wirelessly.The ZiiO arrived quickly from Amazon in great shape.  It was a snap to get started, since it really only required that you charge it.  After that, it started and worked just fine.  I don't own an IPad or other tablets; so, I wasn't sure how this would perform as compared to my computers.  Overall, it's been great and perfect for my wireless work at the office.  The ZiiO's screen is sharp and very bright.  Using the touch screen is easy.  I prefer to use the stylus since my fingers will often hit more than one button or option.  But, it's really sensitive and responds very easily.  I ordered the screen protector, to avoid scratches; this went on easily and does not interfere with the screen's performance.As far as getting and using apps, it's been no problem.  I prefer to use the ZiiO Space website, which connects you with a free Android app site.  These download seamlessly.  Once downloaded, you install them and move the icon to the desktop screen, for easy access.  Then, you're good to go.  I've tried watching YouTube videos, and these look and sound really good.  The included Android browser is fast and sufficient for my purposes.  If you want a more comprehensive browser, you can get the app as mentioned above.  The sound from the small speakers on the bottom is clear and sharp, although more volume would be nice.  I haven't tried using headphones, but I expect that the sound quality and volume would be excellent, given my experience with other Creative MP3 players.Overall, I have to say that I'd definitely recommend this tablet for those looking to browse the internet, play games, or do basic tasks (especially using apps).  Even when going on standard websites, I've found them easy and relatively fast to navigate.  The keyboard pops up when you have to type or fill in a response on the webpage.  The 7\" screen size is just right for me, being larger than a cell phone and small enough to hold comfortably in one hand.  It's too bad that the Creative ZiiO tablet does not get enough press in the US market.  However, given what you get for the lower price, I suspect that sales will go up quite sharply as word gets out.6/8/2012 Addendum:After having success with my ZiiO 7 tablet, I decided to order a ZiiO 10 for home.  And, like the other, this one has functioned very well and is definitely worth the extra money.  (Of note, it did take some minor adjustments when first setting up after taking it out of the box and charging it.  The touch screen adjustments were all off and had to be properly aligned through the settings menu.  After doing this, the tablet was up and running great.) The 10\" screen makes playing games and surfing even easier than with the 7\" tablet.  I primarily use this tablet at home, for those purposes (versus the 7\" tablet which I use in the office).  Prior to purchasing the larger tablet, I had not tried the bluetooth features.  I really wanted to have a bluetooth speaker for when I'm on the computer in order to listen to my favorite internet radio stations.  So, when I was given the Big Blue Speaker (from Brookstone) for a gift, I quickly paired it with my ZiiO 10.  It's been great.  The pairing was quick and simple.  ZiiO connects easily every time.  And, the music streams perfectly; the X-Fi enhances the sound and is a nice feature with this tablet (since Creative is well known for their Sound Blaster equipment).

My biggest concern was the single-touch screen but that really hasn't been an issue.  For me, the pros and cons of the Ziio have been...Cons:- Doesn't have the Android Market, but see the first \"pro\" below.- The screen is resistive instead of capacitive, which means that it can't support multi-touch.  You can't do things like pinch to zoom but in my opinion, that's pretty minor and it has really only been a \"problem\" when playing a select few games.- The home, back, menu and search buttons are a continuation of the screen but they aren't backlit, which means that you can't see or feel them in the dark.- It doesn't charge through USB.  You have to connect a separate charger.- The mic doesn't seem to pick up sound very well, which is a problem for video chat and can cause feedback if the other person has to crank the volume up on their end.- You can play Flash videos on select sites only.  They only play fullscreen, in the video player app and even on sites like YouTube, I've gotten errors about unsupported formats.- The firmware updater doesn't check to see if you already have the latest.  It will let you repeatedly \"upgrade\" to the same version for hours if you want.  :)- I wish it had a regular SD slot instead of MicroSD.  You can get a bigger, faster SD card for less and it's not like the Ziio is phone-sized.- So far there doesn't seem to be any support for 3rd party firmware like CM7.Pros:+ Runs the Amazon App Store.+ Has a decent processor and amount of RAM.  Games and videos play well.  I play games and watch movies (in MPEG4/H.264 format) a lot on plane trips.+ The battery life is good.  It might go a week or so on standby.  If I'm just doing a little browsing or playing some games before bed with the wifi off, I would expect to get a few days use out of it before recharging.  The wifi definitely is a battery killer though.+ Has a MicroSD slot for up to 32 GB of additional storage.+ Runs Android 2.2, which is good enough for most apps out there.  Although 2.3 seems to be a common requirement for certain types of apps, like video chat apps (Fring excluded.)+ The screen is good, although the off-angle viewing isn't great.+ Has Bluetooth.+ The speakers are nice, especially compared to the Nook Color.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "My fave toy", "Author": "Kendra Brown", "ReviewID": "R2V8I7K2Y7YTD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was researching getting an ereader when I came across the ZiiO.

Creative have NO facility for you to ring up a customer services team. If you want advice on a product, want to return an item for a refund, or want to make a complaint, its hopeless and it became apparent over the following weeks that they just arent interested and make return of an item and refund of your purchase fee as complicated and drawn out as possible. You wait days for them to respond to any online query - you cant return an item until they send you a return authorisation code and print-off address label, so you are delayed waiting for that. When they receive your item they do not confirm receipt, despite what royal mail tracking may be telling you about delivery date. They insist...would you believe..that you must send them a 'scanned' copy of your return postal receipt, otherwise you cannot reclaim the postage fee. Then, to top it all, they tell you that you must wait a further 30 days from them receiving the item back, before you will have the monies refunded to your bank account.

Kindle reading app is great. I use firefox mainly,  but Opera works great too. I dropped a t & t for my internet on my acer and now pay 90$ a month for 10gb of 4g on verizon mifi. works outstanding. For the money I love it.Update Sept6th,2012:I've had the Ziio for six months now and to any who wrote negative reviews, what the heck do you want for this amount of money.I use my Ziio now 90% of the time, it's easy, small and does a great job.I use Verizon MiFi to connect to the net and I've not had a single problem doing so. The prepaid mifi is $90 for 10gig. More than what we use and twice as much gbs fo half the money of what we used to get from att.The color is great,  upgrades are simple, downloading app from the Amazon App Store is easy. The only problem what so ever I' had was trying to download Mozilla Firefox from Google play. Maybe it's me, but the scene says if it doesn't start then the tablet is not on the list. Hard to imagine Creative Labs not being on the list. But I got Firefox from the Amazon Store. I Got Kingsoft Office from Amazon and works great.Technical point I don't like but fixed, the four control touch buttons really need to be back lite, could have done it from the screen light.  the bottom shows labelmaker labels on the white plastic to help me with the touch buttons. I'll include a video to show how mine is set up.as soon as I get it down to 100mb.

I get the impression that Creative are not really pushing this, I suspect that they don't have enough resources and/or interest to really make their own big \"app store\" full of apps that have really been tested on the Ziio.That said, the pricing at this time is competitive (maybe they just want to get rid of their stock and forget this product?), so if you are willing to muck about finding apps yourself, getting the apk files onto the Ziio (e.g. plug it into your computer via USB and copy the files to it), installing... then it is fine.Addition: after 6 months or so, this drives us nuts not having Google App Store/Play support - every app is on Google Play, we have to go hunting around for how to find an apk file.

Wish it could do file xfers via bluetooth.  Also, I have to do a hard reboot just about once a day, not horrible, but that you have to do it at all implies stability issues?  More down the road?  Who knows.The processor is proprietary, I guess; it runs android 2.2 fine.Not much of a game player, but of the few I've loaded (actually, others have loaded), about half of them seem to work properly . . . maybe more than half.The HDMI out is really cool -- only watched a bit of one or two movies, but quality was good.  Some ghosting, but might be the source.  Also, sort of wish it didn't have to be a mini connection (C, I think) on the Z10 side; the cable was only like $10, but the nickels and dimes start to add up, ya know?  The vids run and look very nice on the Z10's screen.The usb is the kind that most of the other Creative products I have use (which is the more common connection; Mini?) so that's cool.  Wish the unit would charge via the USB.SD Card support: handy.Resistive screen:  works fine.Definitely need to back light the front panel buttons.A case would be nice . . . even a cheap one that would protect the screen -- as it is, I bought a $10 soft case made for netbooks and it fits very well -- more nickels and dimes.Stylus came with it . . . now, if I could only find it.  :)  There should be a way to attach the stylus to the unit.Just got the bluetooth D100 speaker and looking forward to hooking that in.

It was decent while it worked but it kept crashing and crashing for unknown reasons. Thought it was the battery but even after recharging it would go down again. You can't download anything from the android market but if you download apps from another source i.e an android smart phone they will run fine on this tablet apart from Skype which does not work anyway. Keyboard reduced functionality can be fixed by downloading an app named swype which makes typing much easier compared to its original keyboard. Many of its software drawbacks can be fixed this way. Also you have to be aware to open system manager regularly and close down programs that run in the background. If you don't pay attention to this its performance will be severely affected. The screen is ok although not of the highest quality. One big advantage of this sort of tablets that make them more competitive to Kindle or other similar devices is the fact that it can read pdf files through a great variety of good readers. It offers microsoft office functionality through 'documents to go' with some basic edit capabilities. Videos are ok although u tube will not open on this table unless another program (best tube is downloaded).I don't know if my device (returned today) was defective but by reading other reviews I realise I am not the only one who had similar problems.

I only used the Netbook computer to listen to internet radio, and the ZiiO was advertised as being internet capable with wireless b/g. After the initial setup I was able to access the internet and tried the two main internet radio stations I listen to. WBGO.org ( a full time jazz/blues public radio station in Newark New Jersey) and WQXR.org ( a full time classical public radio station in New York City). In each case the main web page came up but when I went to the \" Listen Now \" function there was no sound. I went back through the settings, accessed the music application, (Each of the stations also support several streaming formats and in the case of WQXR a streaming format for the Android O/S, none of which worked) etc. Several hours later that included an attempt at downloading the Winamp application for Android ( and finding it is only for phones, in order to get the application you have to submit your phone number, but the entertainment tablet is not a phone ) I was forced to the Creative ZiiO application download sight where I downloaded and installed XiiLive/Light (and for a price you can get the full version. Hay Creative don't forget to nickel and dime a loyal customer). I was than able to receive the music stream from the websites, now the buffer would fill to 100% and than empty to 0% and than refill to 100% each time the music would stop at 0 and begin again at 100. This is unacceptable performance from a company who's main products are sound and music reproduction equipment. I have had many Creative MP3 players and sets of GigaWorks T20 and T40 speakers( and all of the players and speakers are still operational) over the years and given them as gifts and recommended Creative products to many people. The ZiiO has been sold to the public way before it's time. Streaming music has been available for too many years. A unit like this should play it right out of the box.

Even worse, when I tried to install a couple of apps--Evernote and Kindle--it was impossible to do so. They (Creative) have their own market, apparently, and they have a \"trap\" that diverts you to that market when you try to install anything directly. And in the case of the two apps I mentioned, installation was blocked by their software. They say you can download to a PC, and copy to the unit, then install from there, but there was no real way to do that, as the file explorer application on the unit didn't display the folders that I could see from my PC.I'm not a computer wimp.

A. Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R2TQE4UMNDMOVF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I will be updating this review in about two weeks, but I think what has happened with the product so far warrants review as it's an experience I would want to know about when making my purchase.I currently have an iPad but was given the opportunity to review the Dell Inspiron Mini Duo. My first impression out of the box was that this is an impressive product. The casing appeared to be high quality, with good button response and a firm swivel to the screen. The back was much nicer than my iPad, the grip is smooth and comfortable. Certainly on specs alone I was extremely interested in what this tablet / laptop combination had to offer. During set up I was also impressed with the the ease of using the touch pad. (Non-responsive lap top touch pads are a key issue for me.) All the signs were good. Setup took an extremely long time, with what seemed to be numerous unneeded 'I Agree' and set up screens. I expect that when working with Windows, so no points off there. Just as all of the set up was complete and it was time to configure the security software preinstalled, the screen went black. The system crashed completely, and the error beeps indicate a motherboard failure. Still no points off, while unfortunate, defective hardware can occur. I called the help line.After 14 minutes on hold, I reached a person. She was extremely polite but it was very difficult for us to understand each other so a lot of repeating was involved. At 25 minutes into the call she had taken my name and we were discussing the problem. Despite telling her the screen had gone black she wanted to know what error code I saw. Nothing, the screen is black and the unit is beeping. (I can't turn it off either.) Despite telling her I had gotten the unit less than an hour ago, she went over the data loss I would be experiencing and explained that I needed to return the unit for repair, sans attachments. I explained I had no attachments and asked why I was sending a brand new unit in for repair. Why wouldn't it be exchanged? The answer was that it needs to be repaired. At 32 minutes into the call she had taken my address and explained it would be two weeks for the unit to come back to me. I let her know I had a review on the product due, was this the only option? It was.If I had purchased this unit at retail price, I would be extremely upset with Dell. Here the points start coming off. She transferred me to a supervisor to rate her helpfulness. I said she was quite polite, and the supervisor asked if she had informed me there would be data loss. I told him there was no data to lose, the unit had arrived this afternoon and failed during set up. I explained I needed to review the product, was there an exchange option open? He assured me the unit would be back from repair in 8 to 10 days if I mailed the unit in promptly. I thanked him. I will update this review when the repaired unit arrives, but if I had purchased this product I would have refunded it. I am disappointed in the product so far and could not in good faith recommend it. Hopefully, my impression will be more favorable when I have the repaired unit to test.UPDATED to 2 stars 2/26 - I was called by Dell technical support today and told not to send the unit in as this was a 'known issue'. Tech support said they found this problem could be solved by booting up in test function, and then ignoring the test. (In order to do this, I turned it on while holding down the FN key, then bypassed the screen when it did boot. I did not get a repeat of the black screen.) No explanation was offered or understood as to the cause of the black screen or not being able to turn the unit off, but the unit is working now. I am charging it overnight and should update the review again by the 28th. I still don't know the cause of the initial failures, and tech says if the problem becomes chronic (we weren't able to agree on a definition of chronic) that it should be sent in for repair. I spoke with two people at tech support today and they were as helpful in the phone call as they were unhelpful in the prior. Both apologized for the problem occurring and not being resolved prior, both urged me to contact them via an email they sent to me (received) for future need. A cynic would think they read the review, but I think it's more likely someone caught the work order and questioned it.UPDATED to 3 stars 3/1 - I've been using the Inspiron Mini Duo for a few days. I have my reservations about it because of the CS experience and the lack of explanation for why it bricked, giving a false code for motherboard failure. Knowing that could happen again at any time means backups have to be religious and external. (A good idea, but not one the average netbook user is going to follow). Setting that aside, I do like the design of this unit. The touch screen was responsive even before I calibrated it for personal use. Flipping the screen from netbook to tablet in the middle of a task works seamlessly. I can see a solid use for this at once as an e-reader replacement. Start a book with the keyboard, flip the tablet, and you can read without having to angle your head. The keys have a nice responsive feeling, the tracking pad is smooth and accurate. As a netbook, I think this is a better choice than many I have used. As an iPad killer, not so much. While the much larger drive and built in keyboards are welcome, the Inspiron is not a true tablet computer. The load time for initial use and individual programs is still much longer than an iPad. You won't quickly and effortlessly move between applications. As with my laptop, there's plenty of hurry-up-and-wait with the netbook. It will probably gain speed when I strip it of the pre-loaded software, but it will still be a netbook with added functions, not a tablet with a keyboard and track pad. All of that said, for the price point it's a nice machine with above average looks worth considering. If I hadn't had the early CS problems, or if I had a better understanding of the chances of recurrence, I'd probably go four stars. As it is, from one to three is as far back up the scale as I can comfortably go.UPDATED April 20th - this has been used pretty much daily without a repeat of the initial failure to respond. I'm beginning to think it was a one time event as operation has been fairly flawless with the usual issues you might find with a net book. The tablet is holding up very well, no signs of stress to the hinges at all. Connecting it to the home network has shown we're more likely to use this tablet than the main machine, the longer I own it the more I like it.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Little guy packs a lot of punch!", "Author": "Kula", "ReviewID": "R337H3MGY7F6ZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this computer Saturday and have not stopped playing with it. My first impressions were that the size was perfect and the flip screen was an excellent added bonus. Just the flip screen alone would make me buy this over other computers, and then the fact that it is a touchscreen sealed the deal. All in all this, is a wonderful mini computer with a few flaws, but nothing that is a deal breaker.  This computer comes with all the features standard on Windows 7.  Also comes with a trial version of Microsoft Office, but I do not find the need to buy the license since this is not my primary computer.Touch Screen-The thing I was most excited to try out, it is responsive and easy to use.-when the screen is flipped a little slide out keyboard can be seen midway up on the left side, one touch and it slides out.-here you can type with the keyboard, or you can draw letters with your fingers and it will automatically turn it into text-the touchscreen takes a little bit to get used to in terms of learning where to touch to get the right letters hit, but what helps you to learn where you are actually touching the screen, is a little tiny diamond appears where your finder hits the screen, so you can see if you need to go more to the left or the right to get a precise touch.-if the computer included a stylus that would be a much welcome addition.-I love the fact that I can flip the screen and use it as an e-reader.  Works will with the Kindle app as well, plus you get the bonus of a color screen when you're reading.Camera-We used google chat to test out the camera an it worked really well, no bells and whistles (there is a camera program that you can use to make different backgrounds, etc. But nothing special)-the camera program takes a minute to load, but works well once it is loadedStorage-With a 320GB hard drive, it had more space than my first 4 computers did, combined! Need I say more?-Immediately loaded over 4,000 songs onto the hard drive and this did not slow down the computer or even put a dent in the available space.Keyboard-I do not think the keyboard is small and the keys are just the right size-the keys are reasonably spaced, like that of a MacBook and look niceBattery-The battery life isn't spectacular, but 3.5 hours and it runs a whole computer I think is pretty good.Flash-Love that it has flash (Sorry iPad)Cons-with only 2GB of RAM to run most programs, sometimes things load slowly (well, most of the time things run slowly). When next to a MacBook Pro, the MacBook took 2 seconds to load most web pages while the net book too about 10 seconds. But this isn't supposed to be a primary computer, and it has half the RAM that the MacBook has, so thats not a big deal.-no card reader, but it has 2 usb ports which is nice for loading media-I really wish it came with the dock, which has a card reader-I wish it came with a stylus, but this can also be ordered separately-sometimes the cursor gets lost on the screen while using the touchpad. The only way to bring it back is to touch the screen.So long story short, this is definitely the best mini computer in its class because of the large hardrive (most are about $200 less and have 1GB RAM and a 250GB hardrive) with all the advances in technology, I think it is definitely worth the investment to get the bigger hard drive. This netbook is so portable, I cannot wait to travel with it, yet nothing is compromised or left behind because its large hard drive.  Overall, I have to keep telling myself that this is a netbook, not a regular computer. As a netbook, this Dell does the job and does the job well.

And, in many ways, Dell did a good job in execution; there are many strong points to the Duo. Unfortunately, the overall product is marred by very low battery life and as a tablet it's bulk. But you do get a fully functional netbook running Windows 7 home professional with a vast amount of storage (compared to other tablets) that converts into and out of a touch screen tablet within seconds. This makes the Duo good for work or typing intensive tasks and also a fun media consumption/apps/internet viewing device for play.First the good: I like the Duo as a netbook. It has a very responsive and easy to type with keyboard. Each key has a great feel and they spaced the keys well. The mouse also works well. I have loaded Office 2010 Professional Plus and all the programs work fine. You get a large hard drive. This is a major plus to me. The Xoom recently came out at $800 for 32gb. My music collection alone is that much. With the Duo you can take your media with you...all your media for most people.Also overall on the good side for a netbook and this also pertains to the tablet is the overall performance speed. It is good but not great. Internet surfing is decent and using Firefox as your web browser helps improve speed even more. Office apps work very well as do other applications I have used. But switching between apps and programs you are not going to get near tablet speed, but I am ok with that if it means having a full function work computer when I want, and lots of space for my enjoyment of media when I want.On to the tablet. As you can see, it really does take seconds to convert the Duo to a tablet. When you first convert to a tablet the Dell Duo Stage interface pops up. Right now it gives you shortcuts to a handful of media consumption apps; your music, the Bilbo book reader, videos, a drawing app, etc. You can easily go in and out of the Duo Stage interface. The Duo Stage apps are nice to get to your media; books, videos, pictures. The Bilbo book reader has a lot of promise. There is a supplied Peter Rabbit book that just looks fantastic. I personally think the promise and potential of book readers are on tablets Kindle is great for what it does, but on tablets you can get all kinds of neat things; great looking children's books, fantastically interactive textbooks that link to videos, study chat rooms, the sky is the limit for ebooks on devices that can support advanced functions. The downside to book reading on the Duo is the weight and the poor performance outside. The Duo is around 3lbs and you can't use it in direct sunlight. That being said I do like using the Bilbo reader, Kindle, or Nook around the house.The overall Internet experience is greatly enhanced for me when using the Duo as a tablet. I like to hold the Duo in tablet form when browsing websites. Especially on a netbook sized screen it makes web browsing a lot more enjoyable. The touch screen is responsive and the pop-up keyboard (you can also use a stylus) is quite good. Very responsive virtual keyboard but in landscape or portrait mode I have to use one finger. I can't hold the Duo and do 2 finger typing. Needless to say watching videos is great in tablet mode (if you hit the screen `sweet spot') without a keyboard in the way. Zooming in and out with finger pinches and rotating the screen is not as good as an Ipad but it is serviceable.I luckily came across a new Intel website specifically for netbook apps. It is called the Intel Appup store. You are giving up a lot of cool apps to go with the Duo as compared to the Ipad or Android based tablets. But the Appup store makes me feel better about the potential of the Duo and its successors going forward. Yes there is Angry Birds, and it works great as a touchscreen game on the Duo. A cool feature of the Appup store is you have a day to try something and if you do not like it you can cancel the order. In addition to Angry Birds, I have also downloaded apps to manage my social media sites (Tweetdeck is working very well) and some news apps. I think it would be great if Dell was able to bring the OS for the new window based smartphones and that universe of apps to the Duo. Not sure if that is possible, but at least I am excited to see how the Appup store expands and evolves.The screen is very good in Netbook mode when you can easily get the exact angle that is best for your viewing position but it has a real sweet spot you need to hit using it as a tablet. Tilt it too much one way or the other and quality goes down markedly. It also does not perform well at all in direct sunlight. I don't have an Ipad but I do have an Iphone 4. The Iphone performs better in direct sunlight. Those limitations noted, 720p or 1080p video from Youtube looks pretty darn good as does HD Netflix streams, so I'd have to give the screen overall a good grade.Now to the bad: battery life is really short for the Duo. It really is a shame because otherwise this could be a great portable work computer, college computer, business trip computer, and vacation road/trip computer. I get around 3 hours of battery life fresh from a full charge with web surfing, office programs, and some video. I get even less, more in the low to mid 2 hour range, if Netflix or other video apps are mostly running. With better battery life the Duo would have been a solid 4 stars. Sure you are not going to be able to get Ipad battery life, not with the hard drive, flash, the Duo's chips and the screen, but Dell should have shot for 4.5 to 5 hours, even if that meant offering 2 price points with a higher one offering a larger capacity battery. No way was I expecting 10 hours, but at 4.5 to 5, heck even 4 hours, the Duo would be a much better product.My overall impression is that the Duo concept is going to appeal to a lot of people who are considering tablets this year and the coming years. For me the Duo is a more useful and appealing package than an Ipad or an Android tablet in many ways. I have a Smartphone. I love it. It is the ultimate in portability, has a fairly long battery life, and fantastic apps. But I personally can't justify spending upwards of $500 or more for tablets currently on the market, although I have been very tempted, for what amount to a large screen smartphone. Yes they are neat, but a netbook/tablet has so many more uses for me. I have a 17 inch notebook but it mostly stays parked on my desk.With the Duo I find myself taking it with me everywhere in the house and yard (when not in direct sunlight). It is super portable and just a wonderful companion around the house. My wife or I are constantly using it to play or work. We now have a full function Windows computer with us in every room of the house, not just a tablet. But battery life limits the Duo outside of the house. Also it doesn't function as fast switching between apps as a stand-alone tablet does. The tradeoff though is the Duo does function as a full computer which tablets do not. Real flash is nice as is a good keyboard and 300 odd gig. Having every link on my tweet account actually open = sweet.Literally as I write this I am seeing the Ipad 2 announced that is sleeker, thinner, and lighter and faster than the Ipad. But the screen resolution hasn't gone up and the maximum storage memory is still 64 gb. The thing I would keep in mind, is EVERY tablet or tablet hybrid involves some compromises. The Ipad 1 or 2 or Xoom etc. are going to be far from a perfect product for most people just as the Duo is not a perfect product. If a full function netbook appeals to you that converts to a tablet and if you are ok with the poor battery life and willing to settle for less than non-hybrid tablet speed switching between tasks but more computing options overall and way more memory than a tablet I recommend the Duo. If not, but the concept of the Duo is still appealing to you, you might want to wait for a Duo(ver) with I would expect a much better battery.About the video, I had to downgrade the video quality and length to meet 100MB. So it does not at all do justice to the screen. But I hope you still get a sense of how easily it switches to a tablet and generally how it operates.Some well done very appealing features, lots of promise, but compromised by bad battery life.Update 3/16/11. Having now used the product a couple of weeks more I want to say that I like it even more. I feel even more strongly that this is a great idea that Dell, HP, and Asus, etc. should all pursue to make better. None of them may be able to 'out tablet' Apple, but I don't think they need to. Since my review I have used the photostage, musicstage, and videostage apps a lot more. They are really nice, particularly when you download a large chunk (or all of) your music, photo, video libraries. I especially like the photostage app. I have downloaded virtually all my photos (like 20 gig) and because of the touchscreen you can easily find the ones you want to view. It also links to facebook, if you want, and then displays with the newest ones coming first, photos and videos on all of your friends' pages or only friends you select.I now think of the Duo as a touchscreen netbook, not a tablet. It is a solid choice as a second computer around the house and of course is super portable (although obviously heavier and weaker battery compared to tablets). My wife has it on a trip to her Dad's right now and we were able to put all of our video and pictures from the last few years to share with him. She tells me he is loving looking at all of them. It is also so great to take from room to room around the house. And really for day to day use out and about, I prefer my Iphone to an Ipad anyway. For home use the Duo does a lot of things better than the Ipad or Xoom.I think for this version the overall 3 rating still remains given the limitations I noted in my original review. But if you intend to use the Duo primarily at home or in other environments where plugs are available when needed and cradling the Duo on lap or propping it up in some manner when using it as a tablet is acceptable then the benefits I mention might easily make this a 4 or 5 star buy for you. The good news is that the bad things are fixable by Dell or someone else. There are much more energy efficient processers available even right now, that would go a long way toward helping with the biggest drawback, battery life. There are going to be much more powerful AND energy efficient processors for future versions by Dell or someone. And generally processors don't cost much. I heard Apple pays $10 to Samsung for the processor for the Ipad 2. Get better suited processors in a Duo 2, add Android or Windows Phone or some kind of App OS, keep the keyboard and Windows, and Dell or whoever would have me getting their product over an IPad 2 or 3. The touch screen aspect to the screen can also be improved upon.Dell just needs to keep at it. The IPad is 'super sexy' right now. But the Duo (and certainly the successors) has the potential to be a much better long-term companion. One last comment. Anyone who has one (or is considering one) and wants more info go to MyDellMini forums. Lots of good stuff there for getting the most out of your Duo.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent - extremely portable and fun", "Author": "Gregory P. Baker", "ReviewID": "R3KW7XN3WVRR4G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This much maligned netbook is a far better deal than the professional reviews would lead one to believe.Having worked with this little gem for a week now, I can say that I'm really impressed, though, of course, nothing is perfect.Out of the box this thing is a tad sluggish, but bear in mind that it's a netbook, not a full blown laptop. Though it has a dual core processor, its an Atom processor, not a Core2Duo or a CoreI. Don't let that frighten you off though. There's more than enough horsepower here to do the kinds of things one is likely to do with a machine like this.Let me start with the design. Personally, I love the flip screen. Being able to flip the screen and make this a tablet sort of device is fun and useful. It's heavy enough at 3+ lbs. You won't be holding it in your hands for long It works beautifully in the lap though.The touch screen is well implemented. In most apps, it's smooth and performs exactly as one would expect. I would say that performance is just a tick off of the performance of an iPad or similar device. I would love to completely avoid iPad comparisons, but at least for now it's pretty much inevitable.Of course the touch screen is HD which was one of the major selling points for me. Having lived with 1024 X 600 netbooks for some time, it's so refreshing to have this kind of resolution. Gone are the days of not being able to reach some buttons at the bottom of unsizable windows.The HD display is somewhat of a double sword though. Some may find that 1366 X 768 on a 10.1\" display is below their limit for comfortable viewing. Things can be a bit small and those with weaker eyesight should consider this. Of course, there are many other available resolutions.As the resolution goes up, remember that the apparent size of things on screen will go down. This means that, at times, using the touch screen can be a bit tricky. You will need to point very precisely with a finger - a very imprecise tool - in order to do some things. But of course, when needs be, one can always switch back to regular netbook mode and use the excellent touchpad.Speaking of the touchpad, it's easily the finest I've ever seen on a netbook. In fact, it's far superior to the toughpads on most full sized laptops. It's plenty big enough and quite smooth. Two finger scrolling is well implemented and aside from the occasion over run, it works great. Though it's supposed to be able to support most common gestures, I don't find that they work that well, if at all. I've never been able to get 'pinch to zoom' to work from the touchpad at all though the docs suggest that it should. This hasn't bothered me because these gestures work so well on the touch screen.In addition to an excellent touchpad, the Duo has a nice keyboard. As a touch typist who has worked with real keyboards for decades, the modern 'chiclet' standard keys have been a bit difficult for me to get used to, but I have to admit that it works. There is significant space between each key and this serves to keep my typing pretty accurate. All of the keys one would expect are present though page up/down and home and end require the use of the Fn key + an arrow. I would have liked to have seen these keys shoehorned in somewhere. Then again, this is a netbook. Backliighting the keyboard would have been a nice touch as well, but I'm sure cost and power considerations wouldn't allow it.My biggest gripe with the Duo is the included ports - or should I say almost complete lack thereof. We have two USB ports and a headphone port. That would be it. I will concede that for the vast majority of users, this is probably fine but many of us would find a few more things like ethernet and vga to be very useful and I suspect most will miss an SD card slot. Ethernet, audio in and out and more usb ports can be added with the Duo Audio Station, but even that lacks any sort of video out. This this thing is so good at multimedia that it really would have been nice to have an HDMI or mini-HDMI but it is what it is. This does serve to keep the machine sleek and svelt, it just limits options.So how does this monster perform. Well, for a netbook, surprisingly well. No this isn't going to replace your desktop. You won't be playing modern 3D accelerated games on this. But would you really have any expectations that you would? Would you really want to play WOW on a 10.1\" screen?Out of the box, performance is fine for the most common things most users will do with the duo. Web surfing, email and multimedia all shine. Watching HD movies (even streamed) is a joy. Office applications chew up your work with plenty of performance to spare. You just have to accept that with an Atom processor and 2GB of ram - you're not going to have 20 things open at once without a serious performance hit and that applications are going to launch a bit slower. In practice, I find all of these types of things work just about as well as they do on my primary laptop - a Core i5 machine with much higher specs.One feature that may bother some is the weak battery life. Reportedly, users get about 3 hours on a full charge. This, of course, depends on the nature of the work you do with it and how you have the power settings configured but don't expect this thing to get you through a coast to coast flight. As is becoming more an more ubiquitous, the batteries (there are actually 2 dual cell batteries as opposed to 1 4 cell) are not user replaceable so the charge you have is what you get. This may be a major sticking point for some, but I don't find myself without access to A/C all that much and I really haven't minded.Dell has added a 'touch' layer of applications over top of windows called 'Dell Stage'. As has been covered in every review I've seen, their implementation is OK, but not great. This stuff turns on automatically when flipped into tablet mode. It gives you icons for several applications that your are likely to want to use in that mode. Video, music, games, drawing, etc. Some are better than others. Some are frankly a sham. The games icon simply opens the MS Games folder and lets you play the same version of solitaire and freecell that you've been playing for years.The stage software can be closed and even disabled though so I don't find it to be much of a hassle. I tend to use other applications for these things anyway so I frankly just don't care much about this stuff.One thing that is a bit of an annoyance is the on screen keyboard. When in tablet mode, obviously, you have to use some touch screen method for inputing text when needed - URLs for instance. When you click in the search box of a browser you (often) get an icon that lets you open the on screen keyboard. I include that 'often' because it doesn't always happen and you have to find the keyboard button on the side of the screen. Not that big of a deal, but I would like to see this work a bit more consistently.Once the keyboard is open, the user is presented with a full keyboard that works ok. It's not great and pawls is comparison to the on screen keyboard of the iPad. This is for no more than entering short pieces of text - like urls. Don't plan on penning your novel in this fashion. it will become a frustrating effort quickly.Finally, I'd like to add that this has all been written with the Duo 'out of the box' in mind. I've taken the plunge and made a significant upgrade that made this very good netbook an excellent netbook. From Dell, the Duo comes with a 320 GB 7200 RPM hard drive. This works fine but technology is moving forward.I replaced the original drive with a 120 GB Intel SSD. This is not an upgrade for a casual user nor is it cheap. The drive is difficult to get to and you have to either reconstruct the new drive or clone it from the original. None of this is 'that' hard, but I would advise less experienced users that consider this to find a pro to offer some assistance.The performance upgrade is remarkable. Boot time dropped to half of what it started at and applications now launch blindingly fast. This is still a netbook so don't expect miracles, but the difference is amazing. I'm actually quite surprised that Dell doesn't offer an SSD as a factory upgrade, but I suppose the cost involved might scare some off.Not to get too technical, but....One of the reasons the SSD works so well to increase overall performance is the paltry 2 GB of native ram. Given this, Windows must rely heavily on a swap file on the drive. Even at 7200 RPM constant reads and writes will slow things down at times. SSDs read and write at such high speeds that swap file access is now nearly as fast as reads and writes to the ram. This is the theory behind the recent Macbook Airs and the reason that such poorly spec'd machines can perform so well. Essentially, I guess this creates an Inspiron Mini Duo Air.You also have to consider storage needs. Dropping from 320GB to 120 will obviously limit some of the things you can do. If you want to store dozens of movies locally or a huge music library, you're not going to do it with 120GB. Larger SSDs are available, but a 240GB will probably cost you more than the Duo in the first place. Besides, the original drive (no longer needed) can be inserted in a USB enclosure and used for external storage. This would actually increase your available storage.There is another significant advantage to adding an SSD. With no spinning disks (or any other moving parts of any kind) the SSD uses far less power than a 7200 RPM drive - hence better battery life. I seem to be able to get about 4 hours out of my Duo now where stock devices come in at about 3.I can't speak highly enough about how much the SSD has improved the Duo, but remember that performance is just fine with the stock drive.In conclusion, it should be pretty clear by now that I really like this thing. I develop software professionally and have even written a few things on the Duo. There's plenty of power here to accomplish a lot of real work and more than enough for basic netbook stuff. The addition of the SSD has really woken this thing up even though it wasn't bad to start with.The form factor is attractive and fun. Watching the looks on people faces when they see me rotate the screen is priceless.I can't wait till technology rolls on a bit further and we can get serious processors and much more ram in a machine this size. I can tell you know that when the Inspiron Mini Duo II hits the market I will probably buy it sight unseen based on how happy I am with this.Having a full Windows 7 machined crammed into a tablet is probably more useful than you'd guess. I own an iPad and use it all the time. With that being said, there are things an iPad can't and never will be able to do. I keep both of these in the same case and carry them with me everywhere.

I was very disappointed to say the least.  I first had problems with the accelerometer not automatically adjusting from landscape to portrait when I rotated the duo in tablet mode.  That required a wonderful call to Dell Tech support where they remotely reinstalled some drivers, then tried to sell me an extended warranty which I declined.  Then 3 days later, the operating system comes to a crawl.  After attempting to reboot, it never worked again.  Another half hour call to Dell Tech Support,only to have them state the obvious that the hard drive was shot.  I sent it back to Amazon.On a positive note, I was starting to enjoy it.  A pound lighter would have been better  as an e-reader in tablet mode for it can feel a bit heavy reading over time.  The touch screen was very responsive.  With the Kindle app, I was able to download my Kindle books and it looked very good and the pages turned flawlessly on the slightest touch.  In tablet mode, I used the regular Internet Explorer for browsing and I-Tunes for music since I had no plans of using Napster or their e-reader service. Their movie rental software would have been useful on long trips and the movie trailers did play very well.  The touch screen took some getting used to with Internet explorer for some of those tabs were too small to touch on screen, so there were a few touch misses before I got it.  It seems very well made, on the outside at least.I'm still debating whether to give the Duo another chance for I really was getting into its small size and portability.  I will do a little more research first to make sure there are no hidden problems with this laptop.  Like I said, I liked while it lasted.....3 days.Update 5/21/11  Ordered a new Duo and pleased with it.  It's interesting that the first laptop that died had an odd clicking sound when I tilted it that sounded as though there was a loose screw in there.  The fact that the new laptop doesn't make that sound makes me believe perhaps it was a poorly made or even a dropped laptop.  Don't know.  All I can say is I am pleased with this laptop.  A little more response time when loading applications would make this a five star product but it's pretty good for a first attempt by Dell.  Already downloaded all my pics, Microsoft Office, set up my email, Kindle app. etc. with room to spare.  Bumping up my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  A better CPU and a 4GB RAM slot would have taken it to a 5 star.Update 10/13/11Bought another one a couple of weeks later after this Duo was returned.  Lasted about 5 months before it started drastically slowing down in performance.  The hard drive died again.  Very disappointed in this product and giving up on Dell altogether.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Good Netbook, Tablet Not Ready For Primetime", "Author": "Philip R. Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"", "ReviewID": "R2VHKDE7K47NL4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Background:  I own an HP Mini 210 netbook, and I have a Droid X phone.  These devices set my expectations for netbook and touchscreen performance.The Good:* Sharp Display* Generous Storage* Newer Intel Atom N550 Processor* Very Good Sound Quality* Windows 7 Home Premium Edition* Netbook PerformanceThe Bad:* Tablet Performance* Short Battery Life* Battery Not User Replaceable* Screen Glare* No Wired Network Option* No Video Output* Awkward USB Port Cover* Hibernate Enabled By DefaultOverall:  The Dell Inspiron Mini Duo is a real mixed bag.  While it performs well as a Netbook, it has some drawbacks to consider.  Users hoping for anything comparable to an iPad or Xoom will be greatly disappointed in the Tablet mode.Setup:  There's not much to do here.  Plug in the power cord and let it rip.  The Duo guides you through a few simple steps to get up and running in minutes.  One thing of note is that the Duo should not be run on battery power until you have charged the battery for 12 hours.Display:  The screen on the Duo is pretty sweet with 1366 x 786 resolution and 720p playback.  Video playback is sharp and clear; however, you will have to have it at the proper angle in order to avoid glare.  This seems to be common on Netbooks with HD playback capability as my HP Mini 210 was the same way.Sound:  With a whopping 320 GB of hard disk, I transferred my entire music collection over to the Duo.  Using my V-Moda Vibe earbuds, I was more than pleased with the sound quality of the music.  The included speakers are decent, but nothing spectacular.  I would recommend something like the Logitech Z305 USB speakers if you do not plan to use earbuds.Processor:  One of the bright spots for the Duo is the Intel Atom N550 processor that it ships with.  Unlike the N450, this is a true dual core processor.  I notice a significant improvement in performance over my Mini 210.  I believe it is for this reason that Windows 7 Home Premium comes standard.  I still don't use the Duo for much more than web and media, but that is more of a factor of the smaller screen.  I would not want to try to do a lot of word processing or spreadsheet manipulation as eye strain would be sure to follow.  If this is not an issue for you, the Duo has the horsepower to do it.Netbook Mode:  I found the keyboard to be more than sufficient for my needs.  Typing e-mails is a non-issue.  It is a bit odd at first to see light coming through the edge of where the true screen rotates to convert to tablet mode, but I adjusted to this quickly.  I like that the touchpad has physically separate left and right mouse buttons.  The touchpad on the Mini 210 could be frustrating because the buttons would often blend with the pad itself.Tablet Mode:  This is where the Duo truly disappoints.  Windows 7 has minimal support for tablets/touchscreens, but it is not that great.  Dell includes their Stage software that launches automatically when you rotate the screen and convert to tablet mode.  It includes basic apps for music, video, books, and painting.  The icons for web and games are shortcuts to IE and a group of game icons respectively.  The true apps are pretty good, but I found navigation to be somewhat sluggish with the touchscreen.  I also prefer the interface in Windows Media Center, but I found it equally sluggish with the touchscreen.  However the real issues come when you try using a regular Windows app with the touchscreen.  You have to be as precise with your finger as you would moving the pointer with a mouse.  To illustrate this I used Outlook Web Express to access my corporate e-mail account.  I had a number of SPAM messages that I wanted to check and delete without reading.  It took me 4-5 times to successfully hit the checkbox for each message.  I gave up after trying the third one.  Normal slider controls are almost impossible to manipulate effectively in tablet mode.  At the end of the day, the majority of the software is just not developed with a touchscreen in mind, and it shows.General Annoyances:  The battery life of the Duo is fairly short.  I haven't gotten more than 3 hours off of a charge where it is typical for my Mini 210 to get 9-10 hours.  It seems that Dell took a (bad) page out of Apple's book, and the batter is not user replaceable.  I don't use these often, but I have found the lack of video output and wired network support to be annoying.  There is not a way to hook the Duo up to the projects at work, and sometimes you have access to wired rather than wireless networks.  I would also dump the USB port cover.  The soft flap will not close over the mini receiver that comes with most mice these days.  I grabbed a Logitech V220 mouse to use with the Duo since it has a larger receiver that is easier to remove when stowing the Duo.  Finally, in Dell's wisdom Hibernate functionality is on by default.  This is a deadly combo when applying Windows Updates.  The Duo wound up in a bad state where the display would not work (although it was backlit with power) when it hibernated while applying Windows Updates.  I wound up having to call Dell Support to get things working again.Advanced Use:  In an attempt to get a better tablet experience I installed Ubuntu Netbook Edition to dual boot with Windows 7.  This is not for the faint of heart, and in the end the improvements just aren't there.  It does perform rather snappy in netbook mode which one would expect from a lighter weight OS.  There are good resources specific to the Duo for doing this on the Ubuntu forms.  I may try to replace the Ubuntu partition with Android for x86, but the currently available version of Android (2.2) is not optimized for tablet usage.  Perhaps when Honeycomb makes its way over the x86 port.Overall:  The Dell Inspiron Mini Duo is an interesting idea, but it fails at the things meant to set it apart.  I would recommend buying a device that does one thing and does it well until someone develops software that spans the netbook/tablet world better.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent handheld tool!", "Author": "Edward Walker \"ednpatty\"", "ReviewID": "R1SELVIQ60P9HE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will start out that this would not be my first choice for a computer since my tastes lie in a Intel Core i5 2500k sitting next to me. That said, I was pleasantly surprised at how useful this netbook actually is. Initially, I saw the small'ish screen and the tiny keyboard and thought that it would be difficult to see and use, but I was wrong. The size issue seems to disappear once you start surfing or pulling up email. After finding myself grabbing the Duo instead of my PC's keyboard for simple tasks, I found the true allure of this device - portability. Where this thing shines is when something pops up in conversation and you want to check it online and you're there. It has the familiarity of Windows 7 which will make many happy and the ease of use as many tablets (others compare it to the iPad, but I will get to that). Over all, this is a great computer without many flaws.Flipscreen:The first thing I did was loaded Kindle software. It is a natural fit for this device. The screen is clear and, being multi-touch, worked very well for books both color and monochrome.Since there is no CD or floppy standard (one could buy an external USB version of either), I used my ISO making software and put several children games on the 320 GB hard drive and mounted as soft cds. Other than a sound issue on one of them (Windows 7 compatibility problem, I think), kids games worked well with just the touchscreen. Obviously, if the game needs a keyboard, it is better to use it like a laptop.At first, I had problems closing fullscreen windows and and selecting small things because my big fingers would block half of what I needed to see. I noticed that I could assume that it was going to pick up the middle of my fingertip and that helped quite a bit.I had problems with Web navigation initially, too. I had a tendency to highlight text instead of scroll, but I eventually worked beyond that. It was followed by my noticing a oh-so-slight delay in scroll response once I got the hang of things. What was nice about Internet Explorer as the standard browser is that it recognized gestures for forward and backward page navigation. Chrome didn't do that so it must be a Microsoft integration thing.I didn't get NetFlix installed in time to review, but I tried an HD MPEG streamed through wireless and it played flawless. No buffering even (but I had a good network signal). I little media player is another way to view (no pun intended) this device.Memory:I felt 2GB of RAM was adequate but I didn't push apps real hard. If I had multiple programs running, it started to feel a little sluggish.A 320GB hard drive was a pleasant plus. A laptop I use frequently only has an 40GB drive and I am constantly shuffling apps, movies, or music around so it doesn't fill up completely.Keyboard:A little small for the average touch typist, but I didn't have a problem getting used to it. Obviously, the layout took some getting used to since some of the navigation keys were moved from standard, but show me a laptop that doesn't do that.An interesting note - 6 year-olds don't even notice that it is a smaller keyboard.The keys have a better feel to them than I expected, as well.Battery:There have been many complaints about the battery, both life and accessibility. No replacing this one easily. Life ran a few hours, but if I was doing any heavy reading, I left it plugged in.Connections:Two USB, a microphone and a headphone for I/O and a power jack. That's it. I know there is a dock available, but it would have been nice to have a video out (my cell phone has a micro-HDMI interface!).I don't like the covers over the USB and audio connectors. I felt like I was going to tear them off if I wasn't careful and they made it harder to plug in peripherals.Wireless worked as expected and luckily, I have an N router. It made pulling the ISOs and movies from my PC over-the-air fairly quick.I have no need for the Bluetooth (although I am tempted to connect my Motorola stereo headset, but not as of this review) nor the camera (no Skype or other tools).iPad:People have compared this to other tablets (iPad) and it fell short. It doesn't have an intuitive, multi-touch interface like IOS nor is everything on buttons. If you want the features of an iPad, then get an iPad. The Duo does so much more for non-Applephiles with multiple windows, standard applications, Flash, Task Management and no iTunes.To wrap up this review, the Inspiron Duo is great at what it does. Browsing, email, Facebook, eBooks, whatever you need a portable computer for, this can do it. Video editing or online gaming? Not so much. But if you want something for your go-to device, I would choose this over most PCs any day. It is light, defaults to hibernation for fast boots and easy to read. Dell did a great job with this one.

Lucas Parrish \"Gear Junky\"", "ReviewID": "R3RHOAFWLAEZW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had trouble coming up with a title for this review because so many accolades would have done this little machine justice.  Like 'Home Run', 'Have your cake and eat it, too', and 'Perfect, perfect, perfect'.  I read many of the reviews on Amazon and elesewhere about the Dell Duo and most were not favorable.  Which is too bad, because I feel many of the negative reviews have overlooked an exceptional netbook.  The fact that this is a 'netbook' should underscore every point.  Netbooks are just that, subpar computers that are meant for searching the Internet and maybe writing a letter.  They are basic machines with minimal memory, features and they come with an exceptional price.  Purchasing a netbook means making a sacrifice in possibly several areas.  But, this isn't saying a netbook is a piece of junk and not work buying - far from it.  I purchased my first netbook a year and half ago, an Asus Eee PC 1005HA.  Timidly, I entered the murky waters of the netbook world to find these 'crapbooks' are quite capable and fully funtional.  Putting my Visual Studio IDE on my first network was a testament of my faith in the computer, I thought for sure that program would take down my Eee PC.  I found it actually performed better than my company provided laptop with lots of memory and a full size processer.  As great as my Eee PC was, I find my Dell Duo 100x better.  The screen resolution is outstanding on the Duo, meaning I don't have to scroll around anymore to see a whole Internet page.  The N550 dual core processer more than handles Windows 7 and my Visual Studio 2010 IDE.  Since I spend all time at the keyboard of a computer, the last thing I want to do when I get home is spend anymore time at a keyboard.  The Duo relieves me of that burden, I can flip over to the touch screen and put the keyboard away.  I find the touch screen very serviceable and I found ways to make it even more enjoyable.  Turn on the Touch Pointer, you'll get a mouse on the screen that you can customize to your size and visibility.  This allows you to get into those tiny spaces. The onscreen keyboard can be made bigger or smaller by dragging the corners to your required size.  I use the text writer a lot to write short e-mails.  A lot of fun and much less like using a computer than a scratch pad.  I also bought the Duo Audio Station.  Now my computer feels like a cool touch screen device instead of clunky plastic box.  The alarm clock is my favorite, I get a nice ocean sound machine and a rooster to wake me up in the morning.  With the Audio Station sitting next to my bed, I use the JBL speakers to practice with my guitar.  I don't find the Duo slow at all, actually I feel it performs better than the boat anchor I use at the office with 4 gigs of ram, an obscenely large hard drive and some ungodly processer.  My advice is to ignore the negative reviews and buy this netbook, but if you want more features, bigger this or that then maybe a netbook is not for you.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "A powerful and snappy netbook, with a bonus tablet option", "Author": "Doug Winnie", "ReviewID": "R36V5WTI9VL5K2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been doing a lot of research around tablets recently, and really wanted something that had a decent keyboard. After using an iPad for a few months, the device is great, but the typing experience was not ideal. I was generating a lot of typing errors, and my typing speed was greatly reduced. I have a Dell mini netbook that I love, but it was starting to get a little slow for common activities like blogging and media viewing.When I saw the Inspiron Duo, I thought it would be the perfect combination of both -- and it is -- with some catches. Here are some specifics:The netbook performance is great, and the dual-core Atom processor was a great boost to my common activities like using Office 2010, running Windows Live apps, web browser, and media playback.The video graphics quality is good, and the gaming perfomance is decent for basic games. I was even able to get World of Warcraft to play on it, although with a low frame-rate and with all of the graphics features set to the lowest possible setting.Battery life is limited, mostly because this isn't a single-use device like an iPad. I was able to get 3-4 hours per charge.The convertable nature of the device makes it great to watch movies when you are in tight spaces, like on an airplane, train, or in bed.I was able to watch a steamed movie off Netflix without any problem, and was impressed with the sound and screen quality while watching the movie.The touch screen is a great feature and has come in handy a couple of times, but I find that I can't get a lot of accuracy, especially around the edges of the screen. When I use a stylys, things helped a lot.When used with the stylus, the screen is great for doing sketches or quick mockups in applications like Microsoft OneNote 2010. It is a great note taking device to carry around with you all the time.The keyboard is small, but I am able to type at about 90% of my normal speed, which is great for a netbook in my opinion.I do mobile application development, and having the touch screen on this was way easier to test our mobile apps than pushing them to my phones -- Something to consider if you do a lot of mobile app development.The hard drive is very roomy -- In fact, it is larger than the laptop on my new Dell XPS!I don't mind having the covers over the USB ports, but having one over the headphones was somewhat awkward, but not a deal-breaker for me.Also, not having HDMI or SD card support is not a big deal to me.Overall, I really like my Duo. It does everything I want it to and is the perfect companion to my main mahcine (a Dell XPS 15\").

I spent about 15-minutes with it, after looking around for months trying to get my hands on one. My background is as an IT software reviewer and tester for an international computer magazine (several years ago).Pros:Flip screen is convenient, solidly built, and practical to use.Dell stage software interface is easy to navigate.Outer casing has a slightly grippy, rubberized feel to it.Roomy 320GB hard drive which beats tablets hands down.Cons:Dell stage and Windows 7 OS are SLOW on this hardware configuration.When multitasking, you sometimes have to wait several seconds for programs to open.No upgradability, except for the hard disk.Windows 7 is a poor fit for small touchscreens; accuracy requires practice.Playback of video files stored on the hard disk is not always smooth.The innovation of the screen is fantastic. The Atom dual-core CPU and memory (2GB) are poorly matched to the demands of the OS and Dell Stage. Ubuntu netbook edition would be a better matched OS because it places fewer demands on the hardware, leaving more resources free to manage and run programs.I was keen to buy a Dell Inspiron, and after getting my hands on one, my conclusions are that this little machine will benefit from a beefier CPU and level 2 cache, and more memory.

It does not handle having 10 web tabs open very well though or having a lot of things going on at the same time.The feature I like most about this is the touch screen. I have read in reviews that a lot of people don't use it very much, but with me on the other hand I use it all the time.

I needed another computer, but, refused to get anything less than a Dell. I've been a die-hard fan of Dell computers since 1999 when I got my first new Dell desktop. By that time, I had pretty well tried everything else there was and they never would last me. However, I didn't want a bulky laptop, not the fragility of a normal netbook. Dell had the solution! Dell Inspiron Duo was it! With the Core Duo Intel and the large hard drive and the convenience of a tablet! Out of the box, it was a little more heavy than the temporary netbook I was using. Sturdier, more hardy outer shell that is rubberized! Very impressed with that feature, my last netbook was slick plastic and would slide all over my lapdesk and into the floor. The touchscreen was the clearest I'd ever seen on a netbook. Usually had to strain my eyes to see the screen on my old netbook. Sleek design actually thinner than my old netbook, however, there was no VGA output or cardreader to make it thicker for.  I am not a touchscreen fan of any kind and my Husband is befuddled why I would buy one. However, I use the netbook portion more than anything, anyway. After reading some of the feedback for this wonderful machine, I was quite scared that it was going to cause problems.(ie; black screens, shut downs, and crashes.) So far, this thing has worked for me seamlessly in any mode. As for the machine being slow? No. I had my Husband partition the hard drive and it is as fast as any dual core processor I've seen. The internet browsing and multiple actions slowing it down, no again. My internet is troublesome as is, the router that the ISP I have sold to me majorly sucks. The Dell cruises the internet fast and I've had as many as 6 different pages up and it works fine. The ONLY problem I've had is with the SHOCKWAVE. I tried to stream the New Years Eve ball dropping countless times and it made a fluttering sound within the machine and crashed twice. I do know that the websites I was going to was experiencing high volume and I couldn't get the website up on our desktop or our laptop. As for the sound and crashing, I plan to see if there are any issues for the Shockwave itself on the Dell website.  All in all, it is a perfect companion for me and I am not in the leased bit disappointed in it!

Davis \"famousdavis\"", "ReviewID": "R2OZASTVBIA012", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "QUICK SUMMARY:  The innovative swivel touchscreen on this netbook is so useful that I question whether I'd ever buy another netbook without the feature.  For Microsoft users, this has many features of an Ipad -- but with much greater bulk and little of the \"gee-whiz\" factor Ipad owners get.  A few improvements would make this a 5-star product.  Recommended!BACKGROUND:  This is my second netbook that I've owned.  The first is the one I bought a year ago, the HP Mini 210-1084NR which has served me well these last twelve months.  I'll draw a few contrasts between that netbook and this one in this review.*** Note:  Amazon's product page says that this Dell netbook comes with 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium.  It's not 64-bit, however, it's 32-bit.  That's fine, though, since it only comes with 2GB of RAM, and 32-bit operating systems address up to 3.5GB of RAM.WHAT I LIKE:- The touch screen!  Among my fellow IT workers, this netbook got a few moments of, \"Wow!  That's cool!\" but the coolness of owning a touchscreen netbook is short lived, really.  That's not to say a touch screen isn't useful (it is), but don't expect to be hoarded by people wanting to use your netbook like you would be if you were toting the Ipad 2 from Apple.  The swiveling screen that operates with the keyboard like any other laptop/netbook is a terrific innovation.- The keyboard on this Dell is quiet, much quieter than my clackety-clack keyboard that came with my HP Mini 210 netbook.- The automatic re-orientation of the screen based upon how you're holding it is a nice feature that's been around for years in digital cameras and the Ipad/Ipod, but it's the first time I've enjoyed the feature in a netbook/tablet PC.  That said, it sometime reorients itself unexpectedly when I'm moving the netbook around thoughtlessly, and the re-orientation is a little slow to render.- The touch screen makes for very comfortable use of the netbook while browsing the web, playing a card game, using it as an e-reader.  It's surprising to me how much I like this feature, so much so, I probably wouldn't buy another netbook without the feature.- Because it's in a netbook form factor, the whole unit is very easy to transport.  But it is thicker and slightly bigger in its dimensions that you'll need to try-out using any netbook cover you might want to buy for it, since a standard netbook case will likely be too small to fit this bigger-than-average netbook.  It's very light, like a netbook should be.  The power adapter brick is small, too.- This netbook came with relatively little bloatware (unnecessary and unwanted extra programs and trialware software that takes up hard disk space and slows your computer's performance down).  I removed a few programs after I got it, but there weren't the bucketfuls of bloatware I've seen from other Dell products I've used.- This netbook comes with Synaptics touchpad driver.  You wouldn't think that a touchpad driver is something to get excited about, but after spending a LOT of money to buy Dell's premium model, the XPS M1530 laptop, only to learn it didn't come with the Synaptics touchpad driver, I can tell you that having the best-in-the-market Synaptics touchpad driver *does* make a difference!  My favorite feature of the Synaptics driver is the \"inertia\" or \"momentum\" setting that lets you flick the touchpad and your on-screen pointer flies in the direction of your flick, and keeps moving in that direction while slowing down a bit, then stopping.  Using this setting makes it much quicker and easier to navigate using a touchpad, and the feature comes with the Synaptics driver, but not the competing Alps touchpad driver (which my XPS M1530 uses).  I would only consider buying a netbook/laptop that had the Synaptics driver installed.- This Dell netbook came with 2GB of RAM and Windows 7 Home Premium.  My HP Mini 210 came with only 1GB of RAM (I spent more $$$ to upgrade the RAM to 2GB) and Windows 7 \"Starter\", which an abysmal operating system choice.  Home Premium is much better than the \"Starter\" edition.WHAT I DISLIKE:- It doesn't have an SD memory card reader!  I use an SD card infrequently, but I do sometimes remove SD cards from digital cameras and then later transfer the contents of SD cards onto my home server via a laptop or netbook computer.  This Dell netbook doesn't have a card reader, which both surprised me and disappointed me.- The battery in this unit is NOT user-replaceable!  Given Dell's exorbitant cost for batteries you can replace on their other products, you should consider that this laptop will be fairly useless as a cordless device in about 2-3 years time.  The cost of having Dell replace the battery will likely be half the cost of buying a whole replacement unit.  That's a real shame.  The battery life is maybe 3 hours if you're using a lot of power-saving configurations.  A more likely expectation would be 2 - 2.5 hours.- The touch screen feature didn't work as smoothly or as well as an Ipad's touchscreen.  I don't have much Ipad experience since I don't own one, but when I used a friend's Ipad, the touchscreen just worked more smoothly and precisely.  You can improve the precision of touch recognition on this Dell netbook by going through a touch calibration (which I recommend doing).  The one area where I really wished the touchscreen would work well was in using maps, like Google Maps or Microsoft Streets & Trips.  On Google Maps, the processing power it takes to render the map is too great for this netbook, so manipulating the map via touchscreen interface is slow and unresponsive.  On Microsoft Streets & Trips, zooming in/out is a horrid experience of overcompensation, so I never could precisely zoom to the level I wanted.  Overall, the Intel Atom chip inside the Dell Duo is not fast enough to make the touch screen experience a *consistently* enjoyable one.- The default setup of this Dell Duo caused the screen brightness to automatically adjust brighter or dimmer depending on the ambient lighting conditions.  This was an annoying setting that Dell turned on by default.  If I want a bright or dim screen, I want to control that myself, thank you, and not have my computer tell me how bright or dim the screen really needs to be.  This annoying setting can be turned off in the netbook's power options (click Start, search for 'Power Options', click 'Change Plan Settings', then click 'Change Advanced Power Settings', scroll to find settings for 'Display', then turn off the 'Enable Adaptive Brightness' setting).  Add a comment to this review if you need extra help with turning off this feature.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- My HP netbook has the cooling vents on the side of the unit, not on the bottom of the unit, so you never worry about covering the vents by laying the netbook on your lap or setting it down on the couch.  This Dell netbook, however, has its cooling vents on the bottom side, not the side.- The plastic tabs that cover and protect the ethernet and USB ports can be difficult to remove, and more difficult to re-insert so they're flush with the chasis of the netbook.  Not a big deal, but not as nice as my HP.- Why can the Ipad have a battery that lasts for 10 hours, but netbooks like this one only have less than 3 hours of battery life?CONCLUSION:  This is a very nice netbook, but what makes it remarkable is the swiveling screen that's touch-sensitive.  If you'd like an Ipad-like device but need a full keyboard, too, or you need to stick with the Microsoft operating system, than this is a very good choice overall.  Not having a user-replacable battery is real shame, though.  Overall, it's cautiously recommended.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tablet or Netbook-Mini bundle of Touch Screen FUN!", "Author": "LG \"*\"", "ReviewID": "R2YUVPG1ZQFSEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great little computer with lots of extras to boot!

I had it less than a week before I had to give up in disgust and return it.  Now, for people who want to use this for other things, this might still be just fine, but I ran into several issues that make me unwilling to ever endorse this device to anyone.The first and foremost concern, and this was the deal-breaker that made me pack it up and ship it back, is that System Restore effectively doesn't exist on the machine.  You can't roll your system settings back to prior restoration points if you run into trouble, and that's just unacceptable for any Windows computer on the market.  Had I known that up front, I NEVER would have bought the machine, because that is a serious, potentially fatal, design defect.  The reason for the defect is simple: the drive uses FAT32 formatting, and Windows 7 apparently doesn't support System Restore for FAT32.  Why Dell put such a drive in the machine, knowing about this incompatibility, is beyond my comprehension.  Also, don't expect a restoration CD or partition, because there isn't one.  You have to make your own and then hope for the best.  This was another nasty surprise for me because I've never bought a computer that didn't come with one or the other, and nothing in the product information indicated this kind of fundamental lack.  Most computer manufacturers will sell you boot discs if needed, but I wasn't able to find any on Dell's site; in fact, I could barely find any support for, or mention of, the Inspiron Duo at all.  I think they've been quietly sweeping this one back under the rug.Another thing that turned me off of this machine once I had it was the Windows Experience Index.  The base score is 2.9.  The Processor's score is 3.1, the RAM scores 4.5, Graphics get 2.9, Gaming Graphics get 3.0, and the Primary Hard Disk gets the best score of all, 5.9, in spite of its glaring issues.  I've never encountered such a poor-scoring unit, but this also explains why none of the big-box stores have these models on their floors; they would never, ever sell if people could actually try them before buying. This also explains why I had so many troubles with the unit in the few days I tried to work with it.The display IS lovely, but a side-effect of the dense resolution is that touch gets very imprecise.  If you don't hit exactly the right spot on the screen, you'll very easily end up doing something unexpected and unwanted (and my hands are SMALL, and the best stylus of several I tried had even worse troubles than my fingers).  I re-calibrated the screen several times with no appreciable effect.  Many of the OS's bells and whistles also directly interfered with touch input, and my attempts to write and draw frequently got broken up while the system ignored my input in favor of using its memory to make a ripple effect or hide task buttons.  Its ability to interpret my writing was slowly improving, but I had to write in really large letters, bigger than the input utility was designed to handle, just to get them legible.  (It was while I was searching for a way to fix this problem that I discovered the System Restore issue.)  The screen is just too high-resolution to actually use it for writing or drawing, which meant that two of the three reasons I had wanted a touch screen in the first place had gone out the window and the third would do so as well if I reduced the resolution.  There are potential fixes for some of these problems, but most of them aren't actually contained in Windows 7 Home Premium.  You have to upgrade to Professional or higher in order to get them, so expect to shell out at least another $75, minimum, on top of what you've already paid, if you need to customize the touch screen (and you will if you want to do more than just navigate and tap).  I probably would have done that, except, well... no system restore, like I said.Weight is a problem, at least for me, because it's really not something you can comfortably hold in your hands for long periods of time in spite of what they say.  Dell clearly expects everybody to get the dock to go with it, and that dock does restore some other surprising lapses in functionality.  Without it, all you get are two USB ports and an audio-out port (that microphone they mention is the webcam microphone, by the way, not an actual port!) so add the cost of the dock to your budget plan if you're really set on buying this.  Even with the dock, you won't have a video-out port, so plan on shelling out some more money to get a USB-to-VGA or USB-to-HDMI converter if you want to run a PowerPoint presentation, or play to your TV.  Space that COULD have been used to give us more ports is instead taken up by a nonfunctional SIM card slot, which isn't actually supported by the motherboard or CPU.  Pretty as it is - and it IS a pretty little machine - it's entirely impractical.  Someone came up with a nice physical design but then started cutting corners all over the place to try to make it competitive, and turned it into a mess in the process.  After spending an hour doodling and practice-writing with the device, my hands really, really hurt.  There's no way I could use it in a two-hour lecture class, which HAD been one of my plans.And then there's lag.  Everything is super-slow.  The worst lag comes from the screen itself, when you rotate from landscape to portrait and back.  Expect the screen to go completely dark for a few seconds, then flicker, then reappear looking horrible and warped before finally realigning itself in its new position.  Expect it to radically reorder your desktop icons while it does this.  And expect this to happen a lot, if you accidentally tilt the screen even a little.  If you're like me you might end up shutting the rotation off and asking yourself, yet again, why this is a tablet if you can't actually use it as one.Maybe things will improve with Windows 8, but even so, this won't be the machine for it.  It has too much wrong with it on a fundamental level unless your only plans for it involve consuming entertainment media (which, I will admit, looks and sounds lovely on the Duo).  It just can't handle higher-powered productivity applications, and there are plenty of lighter, faster, and less expensive alternatives on the market if you just want to watch YouTube or NetFlix.But don't EVER buy a Windows machine that doesn't have a functional System Restore on it.  That's just outright dangerous, and it's made me really wary of ever buying another computer from Amazon again.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Probems straight out the gate", "Author": "SoCalTeacher", "ReviewID": "RJIONUA696BC4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I received the computer a month ago and I am finally now able to use it.My touch screen had an issue where the cursor would fly to the bottom corner and minimize everything.

So they sent me a box and it was gone for over a week.I was so excited to get it back so I could finally get to play with it but, within the first 15 min it was doing the same thing again.

I'd owned a Dell desktop and was tired of my previous three HP laptops dying on me precisely after 2.5 years of use. I wanted a computer with maximum portability---so I ventured into the world of netbooks and tablets. After research and much consternation, I bought the Duo because it was both netbook and tablet and I had a high opinion of Dell.After first use I was disappointed at how slow the Duo starts up. Anytime I start it up I had to walk away---make a cup of coffee, run out to check my snail mail----anything so I didn't have to sit there while it slowly started up. Opening applications and switching between windows was painful too. It got a little faster when I deleted extraneous software --- Dell's e-reader and the child-orientated paint software. That was unfortunate because I happen to have a toddler who would have enjoyed this. I also gave up on the touch screen by day 3. You need a stylus to use the touchscreen--end of story. And the screen and largest font setting were too small for my eyes.By the end of the first week I'd decided that maybe my disappointment stemmed from transitioning from a laptop to a netbook. I thought I'd tough it out and enjoy all the appreciative stares I got anytime I whipped out my flip top tablet hybrid. Then three months later my Duo went into sleep mode and I had to turn it off to get it to restart. Except it never restarted, it would attempt to restart for hours. And pushing the power button wouldn't turn it off, I had to unplug it and let the battery run out to get it to turn off. I got my computer whiz brother to restore the computer--erasing everything I had on it. But even after restoring it works -slowly-for a few hours and then freezes.I was reluctant to call Dell because I'd heard how unhelpful that can be but after two months of not being able to turn the thing on I finally did it. They walked me through a series of test and declared it a software problem. I barely used the computer in the 3 months it was working and I had virus protection on it from day one----I have no idea how a new computer could conk out like this. They now want me to pay $200 for a one time fix or $300 for extended software warranty. After paying $600 (with taxes and shipping), I don't have any more money to waste on a sub optimal Dell product. I now have a very lovely looking Inspiron Duo paperweight. If you are looking to buy a netbook or tablet, don't stop here---keep looking.Update:I had two computer techs look at my netbook who both quickly confirmed that I had a hard drive problem. Ha!!! Not a software problem. So I call Dell back, told them what the techs found and they too confirmed a failed hard drive. They had me send it in to be repaired. They told me I'd have the computer back in 10 days. Then after receiving numerous blank emails from Dell over the course of a week --- I finally receive an email that says they can't get the parts to repair my laptop and would like to offer me a 'replacement system'. I call in to find out what this means exactly. In very choppy English, and after verifying my name, address and telephone number repeatedly over 30 minutes, a tech finally explains that they would like to send me a refurbished unit to replace my brand new (not functioning) computer. I declined.Since then I've talked to two techs and two supervisors in India who insist it is Dell's policy to replace their faulty products with refurbished units if you are unlucky enough to find yourself with a non-functioning computer more than 90 days after you purchase it. Mine stopped working around the 120 day mark and now I'm supposed to accept a refurbished unit. If I wanted a refurbished netbook I would have bought one.....at a discount. I guess in a month they'll be sending my partially fixed computer to some other unlucky customer as a refurbished unit.If you are looking for a working computer AND good customer service....don't buy from Dell!", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Failed first night", "Author": "Darkwing Duck \"I am the terror that flaps in ...", "ReviewID": "R2F226XFP357AA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just purchased this today from my campus bookstore.

This keyboard is junk; most words I typed using both hands are wrong. The design is fundamentally flawed and the only way to type is using one finger and slowed pushed each key.

If I could, I would give this 4.5 stars. I couldn't give it 5 stars because there were a couple things I didn't really like.First off, it was very quick and easy to setup up, doesn't install many additional software at setup. I love its versatility between being like a laptop and then you flip it and it is a touch screen tablet. You can use the touchscreen in either laptop view or tablet view, which sometimes was hard for me. I have cats, so I would get a hair on the screen, and when I tried to remove it I ended up clicking on something. I would forget then remember, oh yeah I can touch the screen in laptop mode too. It would be nice to disable that sometimes, but I don't know if you can. It would also be nice for a stylus holder on the back of the laptop, kind of like a Nintendo DS.On the desktop, when you first set it up, it only has three icons on it: Recycle Bin, Bookstage, and Cozi Family Calendar. The desktop is very clean and simple when starting. I like that. The ereader, Bookstage, reads e-books in PDF or EPUB format, like a nook.The laptop comes with just a few things in the box: AC adapter and 3 booklets which are: Setup guide, safety environmental & regulatory info and warranty & support info. Would have been nice to have include a screen wipe cloth since I was constantly touching the screen.The notebook has two USB Connectors on the side, which are covered. Also I learned there is a Free Fall sensor that detects if the laptop is in a free fall state and puts the hard drive in a safe state as fast as it can to protect against damage to the read/write head and possible data loss. I didn't want to test it out to see if it really worked though.Some of the things I really liked was it has this ambient light sensor that detects the available environment light and adjust the brightness of the backlight. It has this App called Radiotime which is really neat. You just click on the app and up pops a world and you can spin the world around and click on any tab around the world and listen to the music from there. I was listen to a radio station in L.A. but it also had radio stations in Africa, Europe, and South America to name a few. I also like, when I am in tablet mode, the touchscreen will rotate around so if you turn around the netbook the screen will flip as well. I like that the keyboard is really easy to use and it was a good size for me.I didn't like that there was a double border around the screen. There is the plastic border around it so it can flip and then there is a black border around the screen that goes with the flip. The extra border makes the screen appear smaller than it actually is. I wish the screen went to the very edge. Also, the dell duo stage apps when in touch screen tablet mode is a little slow to start-up. I also didn't like that there is no card reader. It would be easier for me to add my photos with a card reader.I had a hard time getting the touch pad gestures to work for me. I couldn't get it to do the pinch fingers and zoom in gesture at all. But, on the touchscreen the gestures were very easy to operate. I had no problem with using the touchscreen, it came very easy to me.An odd thing I found, was in the touchscreen tablet mode on a browser a keyboard icon will pop up when touching a search bar. But, the icon will not appear when you touch the address bar. So you have to pull the keyboard out that is always hiding on the left side of the screen to type. But, that keyboard is always there for you in tablet mode when you need it. So that is nice.All in all it is a great little netbook. And I love that you can use it as a laptop or you can flip it and use it almost like an ipad. It is fun, and lightweight, easy to transport. I really like it. I would definitely recommend this netbook to anyone.

That said though I really can't picture myself using this for much else besides internet browsing. With no CD rom drive I can't install games aside from like Steam (although it's not a gaming computer, mind you regardless) and there isn't much else I really can picture myself using it for to take up that much room.It's no where near as thin as the iPad (to be expected again since it's a tablet pc not one of those touch screen tablet only pcs).Gets the job done though if you're looking for something like this.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super Great Deal", "Author": "Janio L.

The flipscreen works well and it is pretty neat to be able to flip it into tablet mode for extended throne-room blog reading, prop it up on the kitchen counter for online recipes (see photo) or browse a social network in bed, then quickly flip the keyboard back out if you want to type something.  If the price was comparable to other 10\" netbooks, this would be a winner.  But hundreds more?  I don't think so, especially since it's missing some key features of both tablets and netbooks.I don't own another tablet, but I do have another netbook, the Asus EeePC 901.  The Asus has 3 USB ports, a VGA output, an SD card slot and an ethernet outlet.  The Dell Duo has 2 USB ports and none of the other things.  So I guess Dell has blown off the commercial market for this model, since you can't output video to a projector or large monitor to show a presentation or hook it up to a wired internet or intranet system.  The other Asus advantage is the battery: removable, replaceable and far more powerful.  Like others have written, I get about 2.5 hours on the Dell battery; the Asus lasts for 6 hours or more.On the positive side, the Duo does have a large amount of hard drive space.  I suppose they expect you to load it with MS Office and other large programs.  You could fill it with movies, but then you'll have to plug it in after the movie's over.  Kindle for PC works great on here (throw out Dell's ebook program; it's awful) but at 3+ pounds, you'd better have a powerful grip and strong biceps to read while standing.  The touchscreen works well, the keyboard is comfortable for typing and speaker sound is decent.Overall this is a netbook that sacrifices some utility for nifty design features at a premium, rather than a true best-of-both-worlds netbook/tablet.  I would wait and see if they revise and improve this model.UPDATE: after only about 6 months, the battery is weakened to the point where it doesn't even last for 2 hours.

{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great portable Windows machine, until you need it fixed", "Author": "Beermongler", "ReviewID": "R7XNHRAXEB4I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this for a couple days now.  I loaded Microsoft Office 2010, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 on it without a hitch.  I can use it to show people code, and even write code with the included bluetooth keyboard.  During meetings and presentations I can switch over to one note and take notes with sound or even video recordings when I want to.  After loading it up and removing the few junk programs there's still about 15-20 gigs of space left for misc stuff and you can always get an SD if you need more storage.The Window's 7 touch screen experience is a lot smoother than I expected and it's a breeze to use the computer for multimedia apps like Zune or to surf the internet with the stylus.  Overall I'm very happy I got this.  It's a lot easier to carry around something slightly larger than a sheet of paper and about 3/4 of an inch thick than a laptop.  Even people with Macs are impressed when you flip open the case and start surfing the internet with full flash support and apps that weren't designed for a phone first and a tablet second.Update:After almost a year of use I began to notice some yellowing of the screen in the corners.  A search on the internet quickly showed me that I wasn't the only one with this problem.  I sent the unit in for repair and the only thing they did was wipe the hard drive, re-install everything, and put a paper in the box that said the tests all showed OK.  That's not OK with me.  I have updated the rating to reflect this.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible Asus Warranty Support", "Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "R3PPNGW312FRDM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like other reviewers I was delighted with the product when I first received it.  It worked really well for about 2 monnths and I congratulated myself on finding a really slick Windows tablet which could replace my aging laptop.  While in vacation I was showing photos via HDMI on a TV set which worked fine the first time, but the second time I tried it the slate shut down completely and would not restart.  After much aggravation with the tech support people who were very hard to understand, I received an RMA number.  I then had to pay $68 to buy a shipping carton, insure the product and ship it back to warranty service in Texas.  They returned it fairly quickly and it appeared to work well again but of course, all software had been deleted so I had to reinstall and update all of it.  In the process I also had to pair my bluetooth keyboard to the system, which I had done originally without a problem.  When trying to pair it after the warranty service, the prompt to enter a pairing code allowed no time to enter anything.  It literally gave me less than 2 seconds to enter a 10-12 digit code that it generated.More calls to Asus customer no-service, including discussion with a \"supervisor\", resulted in them telling me that I would need to send it back for warranty service, again at my shipping expense.  Since this was not a re-do of the original problem, but was a new problem, they would not pay for the shipment.  This is totally unacceptable for any product and ridiculous for one costing more than $1,100!  After much complaining on my part the \"supervisor\" offered another suggestion that I go to the online e-store and get a system restore disk to re-set the system.  His feeling is that I have a Windows problem and not a hardware problem.  Of course that system restore disk sells for $50!  So let me see, I have a defective $1,100+ computer that I have paid another $68 to fix once, and still have a product problem for which I have to either pay another $68 to ship back, or pay another $50 to MAYBE fix the latest problem.  Who knows what the next problem will be?  I now know that I can't afford a product like this!I have had many computers and other electronic products in the past, some of which needed fixing and this is BY FAR the worst customer service I have ever seen!  I bought through a local retailer and am past the return period, so I am apparently stuck with this puppy.  Don't let the same thing happen to you!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for what I needed", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R11ORX0N8U2NNK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a university professor, and I've loved using a tablet PC in the past.  Wanting to upgrade to Windows 7 (so I could run some real computing programs in real time for the class), this was the best choice out there -- and I've been very happy with it.One note for teaching or presenting with this -- there is no VGA port (what most laptops use to connect to a projector), so you'll need some type of adapter.  I bought the USB to VGA adapter from CablesToGo, which has worked out well.  When I tried connecting to the VGA port in a classroom, at first the display was a little choppy (with an ugly black cursor in Windows Journal and PDF Annotator), but after downloading the updated driver from the CablesToGo website, everything was smooth as can be. There is a slight delay (about a tenth of a second), which might be maddening for gaming, but for presentations (including real-time handwriting) it is barely noticeable.I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to teach with a tablet -- writing notes to post later as PDF's, while having access to the most commonly-used programs (on the Windows 7 platform), is insanely effective.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Asus does it again", "Author": "Leyland Needham", "ReviewID": "R3DQGUJA803B24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned and have tried several brands of laptops/tablets before. Dell, HP, Fujitsu, Toshiba, and Apple, to name a few. And so far Asus has a very good track record with me, especially when it comes to the quality of the screen. So when I saw the eee slate and that not only was it an Asus product but that it had a wacom digitizer, a multitouch capacitive screen, an i5 processor and was priced under $1500, I had no choice but to get it, and I am happy I did : )So what do I do with this device? I'm a software engineer, in profession and hobby. So currently I'm mostly running Visual Studio, and learning how to develop software for stylus and touch input. But I'm also an artist, I like to visualize concepts, do sketches, diagrams and design type work. So this device allows me to do the things I want to do, things I can't completely or easily do on a device like an iPad or Galaxy Tab.I like the case, it has a nice fresh leather kind of smell to it, having a professional feel. It isn't perfect, as it can at times block the unlock/lock switch for auto-rotation of windows.That said there are things that would have made this product better.While the quality of the Bluetooth keyboard is good, it's Bluetooth. Bluetooth keyboards don't work in bios or Windows safe mode, and can't wake up a sleeping PC. Also they need to be explicitly connected, instead of being automatically connected out of the box. They should either have a bios which supports bluetooth keyboards, or replace the bluetooth keyboard with a wireless usb keyboard, or not have a keyboard at all and reduce the cost of their product.No wintab driver/dll. A number of legacy applications won't work with the stylus because of this. Gimp for example doesn't work. I tried installing drivers from Wacom's website but it crashed the eee slate and I had to go into windows safe mode to remove the drivers.USB connectors are extremely tight.

I also use it with OnLive gaming service without any problems. 1080p plays without any lag or stutter.Pros:1. Not expensive compared to other tablets when you factor in the price of accessories that are built in and come with: camera, keyboard, carrying case, stylus and cool charger with USB outlet.2. Carrying case works really well as a stand.3. Full size Microsoft bluetooth keyboard. Very easy to sync and works great when you have enough space to use it.4. Built-in camera and mic. are perfect for Skype.5. Amazing screen. Easily viewable under sunlight. Glass is a fingerprint magnet, but cleans easily with included cloth. Haven't tried scratching it, but gorilla glass is supposed to be bulletproof.6. Also works great for reading books. Comes with Kindle for PC preinstalled and optimized for touch screens. Flipping pages is as easy as moving your finger right to left.7. When you need more precision than a finger, stylus really helps, but it is not always intuitive. For example, you can scroll by pressing and dragging with your finger, but same action doesn't work with stylus. You need to use the scrollbar.8. It is lighter than I expected, even with carrying case. Very comfortable to take just about everywhere.Cons:1. Power plug is really loose and disconnects from slightest motion. I would really feel cheated if a $1K tablet became unusable because Asus saved $.50 on a power plug.2. Power button is meant to only slide left to right, but if you press it from the top while sliding, it will get stuck and shut down your computer.3. USB/HDMI ports require super human strength to insert and remove devices.4. Stylus is difficult to remove. I always have to play with it for a few seconds before it pops out.5. Bluetooth keyboard doesn't work unless you're in Windows. That means if you're reinstalling windows or trying to get into BIOS, you'll need a USB keyboard hooked up. This problem is not specific to this tablet, but I've seen other BT controllers that allow keyboard to be used before Windows loads.6.

It paired using the ademdum enclosed in the box. Because I needed to re-pair it after an upgrade to Windows 7 Pro (our office uses a domain), it resisted. A little known fact is that if you hold the reset button on the keyboard for 30+ seconds, the L.E.D. will alternate colors and it then pairs easily.For those wanting better mouse control than the touch screen, a bluetooth mouse should work, but there is 2 usb ports that would allow a wireless mouse to work as well. It is important to have the USB so you can add a DVD/CD device can transfer data or restore the system (although there are provisions to restore through a USB memory stick.)The screen is bright and the case serves as a stand either vertical or horizontal. There is a stylus, HDMI port as well.One of the intersting features is the button on the top that opens the onscreen keyboard so you don't have to drag it out from the side of the screen.The larger button near the screen serves as a Ctrl Alt Del key so I can log into the domain.For the size of the screen, it is relatively light, much lighter than a covertable tablet/notebook.Although a consumer oriented device, I see potential in the health field, as I am in, to market this for charting.

I'm constantly using the pen to write emails, reviews :), use my Quicken program, access websites, etc. This is a huge bonus for me personally.

It's in that area where this device really shines for me.Overall, I gave this device five stars for the touch/pen experience, the screen brightness and sharpness, speed (the i5 processor is wonderful), and the leather/leatherette case which protects the device and offers different \"standing\" positions. The device is heavier, which for me is not a minus because I fully understand that this is still a computer with serious horsepower.The only minus is the battery life.

I like using my hands, but for some tasks a styles is more appropriate.2) Tons of RAM - 4GB is a good amount for a tablet.

I run Windows SQL Server, VS Studio 2010, VS Studio Express, phpDesigner 7, and Office 2010 (which has a neat pen function on the Ribbon).  I can also run command line functions.  I could really see a Network Admin on the Beach while monitoring his network using this.4) Ability to Lock and Unlock Screen - When you turn the tablet, it can change the display orientation.  To lock the screen into position is a simple switch at the top of the screen5) Can Expand disk space by 32GB- Adding a RAM card, you can expand the disk space, which is limited on my system at the moment to 64GB6) Accesories - I really liked that it came with a keyboard and Case that allows you stand the unit up and type (Though I have rarely done this.  Most of the time I am on the couch programming in a Lazy Boy)7) Button on right side - System has a button that lets you page through the applications you are running.

The Asus slate is a full fledged computer while still giving you the ability to have fun and be creative. The pros and cons are pretty much what other reviewers have said, but since I would eagerly check out new reviews while waiting to receive my slate (ordered on 2/19, received on 3/11) I will go over them again: Pros:  + Handwriting tool awesome! I tend to  scribble while writing (who doesn't?!) but amazingly the slate gets it right...  though it was after I turned off the auto correct  function, which I recommend.  It's pretty cool to be able to write out documents in Microsoft Word 2010 as well. + Runs windows 7  instead of some mobile OS! Would have liked to have Professional instead of Home but this will work just fine. + Screen resolution is sharp and clear. Watched a movie through Netflix and tried out Youtube no problem. + Runs pc games well (so far tried it with Rollercoaster Tycoon) using a Bluetooth mouse + Accessories a great value. Bluetooth keyboard easy to install, digitizer pen works great, and the folio is very useful (thought had a  strange odor to it initially which went away after a couple of days  of being out in the open). + Incredibly light, even with accessories.

You can do a lot with it, but you need to learn how to operate the thing to really enjoy it.  The USB ports take some getting use to.  They can be difficult to work with but my advice is to not try and force a connector into the slot.  You need to take your time and line it up before trying to connect.  Be careful proping the device up in its \"monitor\" position and then trying to connect a device into the USB slot.  I actually caused the computer to flop over onto the desk and this gave me the ebbie geebies. Fortunately the device does not have a rotating hard drive.  The harddrive that you have on the system is one of the fastest that I have seen but it is small and you will fill it up if you are not careful.  I strongly recommend getting at least a 64 GB smart card. I would also recommend getting a Microsoft bluetooth mouse just to make life easy for you.

It has the power to run large spreadsheets yet is lightweight and compact enough to carry into customer meetings to take notes in OneNote. My only complaint about the unit is they don't give you an option to purchase it with Windows Professional O/S. I had to upgrade after receiving it so that the tablet could be connected to our company domain.---------------------------4/12/2011: Follow Up Review. I have now had the EP121 tablet PC for more than a month (3/3 to 4/12) and I like it more every day!! I use it about 10-hours a day for work. It continues to be easy to use and works great with OneNote as well as all my other apps (Word, Excel, Project, etc). I did buy 2 extra charger units [...]) and now have one for home, work, and travel. I bought an Energizer XP18000 battery power pack for use when traveling but have to wait for Energizer to make the tip available for the EP121; that should extend my time between wall charges to 8-10+ hours (currently about 3.5 hours). I bought 2 extra Wacom Penabled Tablet PC Eraser Pens, model #UP710E ([...] because I was afraid of losing the included pen. They work great with the EP121. I also purchased a Transcend 64GB Class 10 Flash Memory Card, model TS64GSDXC10 ([...] and use that to store my data files. I moved all the \"My Documents\" directories to the Transcend card. I use the internal SSD for the OS and applications. Lastly, I purchased a Viewsonic VX2453MH-LED 24-Inch LED Monitor [...] for my office and connected it via the mini-HDMI connector on the EP121. It also works great but you need to set it up as an extended screen so that the native resolution of each monitor can be used, otherwise it defaults to the resolution of the EP121 (1200x800) which doesn't look good on the Viewsonic monitor. I set it up to use the Viewsonic Monitor as the primary screen and the EP121 as an extended screen.So after another month (plus) of use, I still love this tablet PC. My only additional complaint/suggestion for the EP121; aside from making \"Windows Professional O/S\" an option at purchase (it's a little painful to install); is I would like to see a fingerprint scanner integrated into the design. When you boot the system or bring it out of hibernation, it is awkward and a little unsecure to use the pen to enter your user password. A scanner would allow for easier entry of your PW and prevent someone from looking over your shoulder to compromise it.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Computer", "Author": "MisaMisa", "ReviewID": "R2RUI440EKN52I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a computer, not an appliance. I have an iPad. That is an appliance. There is nothing wrong with appliances, if that is what you want. I wanted one and I bought an iPad. That said, I have always wanted a proper tablet computer, not a flip screen convertible, apple doesn't have one and this comes pretty close. You should (should you)get one, but I want to make sure you know what I don't like about mine.The charger: The tip is non-standard and easy to break. Mine broke off on day one. My cat got caught in the brand new charger wires and nearly pull the brand new computer off the table. The tip snapped off. That is \"good\" I guess. Asus doesn't have a replacement (yet) and good luck finding a replacement tip The inners of the OEM is a spring-loaded basket which grips the skinny pin in the table's dc socket. You can get a smaller tip that fits in the hole, but you are not going to be happy getting it to work. There may be sparks.The USB ports: These are snugg and the small plastic port covers are a pain to get on and off. The ports in mine don't power off when the computer goes to sleep so it can drain the computer. Also, mine has boot issues at times if I leave a drive connected to the USB. Low profile thumb drives, like ones for micro sd cards, are really hard to get back out as it can get caught against the metal frame.The hard disk: This mini-sata drive is simply too new and small. 64GB is fine for an appliance intended to hold pictures and songs, for a proper computer, I think it is too small. iTune is a real space hog so I added a 64GB SD card, but a proper windows 7 machines \"need\" a good 250-500GBs (IMHO). I am managing, I appreciate the concern, but not really keen on the small drive. Like, a few more installs and updates...this baby is doing to be full.The leather case: It is nice. It has a pen holder. You need this holder in the cover because the pen slot cover can't be easily opened with the leather cover on.

I had to have it in my hands, and soon.The packaging was really nice and it was easy to take it out and plug it in for its initial charge.  It gave me time to inspect the case it came with as well as the keyboard.  Good stuff.I've had it for a few weeks now and it owns me.  I've bought so many accessories and other things for it.  It's ridiculous.  I would recommend a slim, portable DVD drive for installing software but everything else I've purchased is simply for my greater enjoyment.I've had laptops before but never a tablet.  I expected to use the keyboard most of the time but I am surprised to find that I rarely use it.  I like using the pen instead, though it takes me forever to send an email now.  I suppose I'll get used to it.  It's more fun than typing.The case that it comes with is pretty cool.  It's very slim and the tablet portion fits it like a glove (the keyboard does not fit in the included case).  It has special velcro tabs on the back that let you stand it up like a laptop screen so if you combine it with the Bluetooth keyboard it's like using a regular laptop.  But it's better because the two portions are not attached to each other.It's zippy fast and it's really cool.  It's nice hanging out and being the one that the other people watch instead of always being the one envious of someone else's technology.  I know that sounded nerdy and I don't care.There are forums out there discussing the Slate, including people who do 3D modeling with it.  It's a powerful laptop, and it shouldn't be compared or confused with fun little gadgets like the iPad and the BlackBerry Playbook.  Those tablets are little more than smartphones with larger screens (ones that don't actually make phone calls).  They have their uses but they can't replace laptops.  At some point you're going to want to run your own software or replace the operating system.  You can't do that with most of the little tablets but you can do that with the Slate EP121 because it's a laptop.  A spiffy, shiny, drool-enducing laptop tablet PC thingy.You know you want one.

I primarily use this device to make presentations in powerpoint, take notes in meetings, and read/edit pdf, excel, and word documents. After installation of 2010 excel, powerpoint, word, one note, adobe reader, and adobe annotator, I was pleased to see that I had roughly 34GB left on the hard drive. The interface is smooth using either touch or pen, but I enjoy using the pen a little more. I notice that the writing recognition sometimes has trouble translating written text that is a mix of letters and numbers, such as email handles (or it could be my terrible handwriting or both). I would recommend this product to anyone who has similar needs.As other reviews have suggested, this device could have better battery life. I feel we always need to make tradeoffs among performance, weight of the device, and battery life, so I didn't expect this device to give me 10+ hours versus the 4 hour average I have been getting.

There are only a few reviews geared specifically to artists, which comes as a surprise given the utility of this tablet for content creators.Let me tell you a bit about myself: I'm a cartoonist who works digitally, and I was tired of being chained to my desktop and Wacom tablet. Yes, I could have dragged out my Wacom tablet and laptop for some work outside the house. And I did, a few times, but the whole setup was so cumbersome that I preferred to avoid this. So there I was... Housebound. Not even just housebound--deskbound. All I wanted to do was sit on the sofa and draw, but I was stuck at my desk while the rest of the family hung out in the living room, watching TV.So I wanted an all-in-one solution. Something with all the power of my digital setup, with the ease and portability of a sketchpad. It had to have a good screen, Wacom sensitivity, and a decent battery.And getting to draw directly onscreen? Fuggedaboutit. Almost every digital artist I know dreams of owning a Cintiq, but with the base model coming in at around $1000, I wasn't getting one of those any time soon. And again, portability would be an issue. I also looked into buying a Modbook Pro, a tricked-out Macbook that's been converted into a tablet with a touchscreen and pressure sensitivity. But for all that, they ask several thousand dollars, which is way above my budget right now. I also considered the Samsung Galaxy, but I needed to be able to use all my usual programs, and those weren't available in the Android ecosystem.Enter: the Asus Eee Slate.Here it was. A Wacom-enabled tablet with a full operating system! I am in love with this machine. It's everything I hoped it would be. I now have the portability of a sketchbook with the ease and flexibility of a digital environment. The base model runs Manga Studio 5 without any hiccups, and I can create finished pages with multiple layers, at 600 DPI. Please bear in mind, though, that this is pretty much the only thing I use this machine for, aside from some light web browsing for reference photos. I guess I wasn't shopping for a tablet PC so much as a digital sketchbook, and at this, the EP121 excels.Re: the Wacom digitizer. I was a little worried that it only had 256 levels of pressure sensitivity. I'm used to working with 1024. But honestly, after I futzed with the pressure settings in my home program (Manga Studio) for a few minutes, the experience is as natural and responsive as ever. I don't see a difference between the lines I create with the EP121, versus my supposedly more-sensitive Wacom tablet. I also needed to get used to the fact that the cursor registers just a hair off of where I rest the pen tip, but all I needed was a few days to orient myself.I'm pleasantly surprised at how roomy the screen feels. I was used to working on a 20-inch monitor, so I was afraid that 11 inches would be a severe downgrade. It wasn't--the aspect ratio is a little odd, but it gives the illusion of more room. Also, the screen does rotate between portrait and landscape mode, which helps a lot.Battery is ok... It's about the same runtime I get with my laptop while running Manga Studio. The power brick is pretty light. I typically don't carry it unless I know I'll be parking myself at the library or coffee house for an hour or two. For drawing during my lunch break, I'm fine.So yeah... It's pretty clear I'm a fan of this machine. If you're an artist who's considering making the leap and buying this, I hope this review has helped. Even used, this thing isn't cheap. With the lack of artist-centric reviews out there, forking over the money was a little nerve-wracking. If you do decide to buy, I suggest buying an SD card for extra storage (my 32 GB model had just enough space to hold Manga Studio 5 and AVG Anti-Virus, though I had to delete poor ArtRage to do so). Also, think about buying some new pen tips for the stylus. I've found that any Wacom replacement nib will do. I like the Hard Felt Nibs.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this tablet!", "Author": "P. Spicer \"PC Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R3GULFZSSR6CAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is exactly what I was looking for to replace my ageing TC4400. Higher resolution means more screen real estate and faster processor means I can livestream while I draw without the tablet having a stroke!My only problem with it is Asus' lack of Windows 8 Wacom drivers, but I can't fault the seller for that.I will say that Windows 8 runs WONDERFULLY on this tablet. However, the program I mainly use for drawing (ArtRage) doesn't play nicely with the Windows 8 stock or Wacom official drivers for the digitizer. As a result, I'm using Windows 7 on the tablet which runs famously. It's just a bit (read: lot) lacking on touch-interface support.If you plan to use this tablet for graphic design, I highly recommend downloading a small app called 'ToggleTouch' which remaps the 'home' button from the default task-switcher to an 'enable/disable finger input' button. Believe me, it's VERY helpful since the palm rejection seems to be a bit dodgy if you don't consciously put the tip of the stylus to the screen first.Speaking of stylus, I also recommend getting a stylus that has a side button. I thought it wouldn't really be a big deal not having it, but I was so very wrong. I was using my TC4400's stylus more than the stock just because it had the side button. I suggest doing a search for \"UP710EA stylus\" for a very nice replacement that even fits in the stylus holder of the unit (contrary to clams in the reviews for said stylus).", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "win7 tablet", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R16E7KRTZ9XV5A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Heavy tablet and  very uncomfortable to hold and forget about typing on it.

My father owns an Ipad through his work, which I have been able to tinker with every now and then, so my experience with the industry's juggernaut is finite but certain.  After playing with the Ipad and owning the Asus EP121, I can say without hesitation that the tablet which I am writing this review on now is superior by leaps and bounds.There seems to be some disagreement on whether the Ipad should be compared to the EP121 and while I can see both arguments, I would side with the one in favor of comparing the two.  Just because one is very different from another does not mean there is no comparison.  The fact is, they are both tablets and they are both expected to perform competently as a mobile substitute for a laptop.The largest and most obvious difference between the EP121 and the Ipad is that the Ipad derives its productivity from the iTunes app store and the EP121 gets its productivity from the programs we use to produce.  Web designers might enjoy being able to construct a website from the bus stop, an architect would appreciate being able to sketch a design from the couch and a journalist might like the ability to take real notes with the Wacom pen.When I read reviews of the Ipad, I often find people with very specific examples of how they made it useful.  Things like, \"I use it to study for tests on the way to college.\"  If that is all you are really looking for, I understand, but in my opinion, those reasons are too trivial for such an expensive device.Folks, the bottom line is, this is the only kind of tablet out there that lets you get some actual work done.  Of course, the EP121 is also fully capable of entertaining you with real games like Civilization V, provided you plug in a CD drive, or full, yes `full' web browsing, that means online games, Netflix, etc.I am not dwelling too heavily on the negatives because if you're reading this review, you have probably already heard about the disappointing battery life, weight and size.  All I would like to add is that the three and a half hours of battery I get suits me fine and I can certainly manage to manipulate 2.6 pounds.It has been two months since I bought this tablet and so far I have not needed my laptop or even felt like I was missing something, but rather that I gained a device that I can prop up on my desk and use like a computer or carry around like a tablet.

It did the trick. I think anyone who enjoys writing over typing will be pleasantly surprised with this computer. The pen-to-screen compensation, aka where your pen physically touches the screen and where it starts writing on the computer, takes a little getting use to but eventually starts to become more natural with use. The battery life of this computer is average. Keep in mind this is a full blown computer not a tablet-toy. As far as computers of this screen size go it has average battery life of about 3hrs on the power saving mode. A quick note, you can purchase a Energizer XP18000 to extend the battery life by around 5 hrs, BUT the Energizer XP18000 doesn't come with the tip for the ep121. To get a tip that works for the ep121 for this external battery you simply have to register the battery and place a order for the tip. The tip will be $3.95 with shipping and has a super fast delivery option if you wana shell out $25 for it. I am very satisfied with the computer, more appropriately termed a slate, and highly recommend it if you are seeking the mobility and function of a tablet with the power of a computer.Update: the Energizer XP18000 will extend the battery life by 2hrs at max settings and 3:30hrs on power saving settings. I dont know If I got a defective unit or what but these are actual times.Pros:-Extremely Mobile-Easy to Use-Very fast (Unlike its predecessors)-Quick boot up-Just the right sizeCons:-Battery Life-Fragile (But with a good warranty from certain stores)", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "I wish I could give 6 stars", "Author": "Enki", "ReviewID": "R2Q6VEIZ1ELXTP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for work, and really wasn't expecting much, I'm a PC guy but have always kept my tablets to apple products and PC notebooks (using corporate builds that left a lot to be desired).Pros-OneNote is fantastic.  Combined with the tablet's stunningly good handwriting recognition (the default OCR even without training is running 95%+ for me) make this a dream for work.  I can write, draw, edit, etc and either OCR the results or push them to another format as is, which saves me from ever carrying around a paper notebook ever again (which is what I was hoping for but really didn't expect to work, its so nice to have some blow through your expectations in a positive way).-Screen is beautiful, perfect size for productivity work and writing.-Boot time and sleep wake-up are really fast.  This is key to saving battery life, meeting getting long winded?  Put it to sleep.  Someone says something interesting?  I get a 4-5 wakeup, 5 sec pass entry and I'm in and writing.  Great tool.-Performance - I get better performance on this than I do on any corporate build laptop, or even a 2-3 yr old desktop.  I've had an RDC going, running itunes to an external speaker, and flicked between OneNote and Civ5 with no noticeable lag whatsoever.  A solid stand-alone computer.-Weight is very light, feels like I'm carrying a nice paper notebook with the nice cover that comes with.-Ports ~ remember, this is a full on Win7 PC, so you've got USB and HDMI ports to use which is fantastic.Cons- The battery life is short with bluetooth/wifi on - say 2 hrs, 4 if you turn them off.  But that's pretty much what I get off notebooks so I'm fine with it.  I purchased the Energizer XP18000 battery with this and I ran the tablet for 10 hrs (wifi off/on about half the time) which is totally the sweet spot I was looking for on international flights.  I don't blame them for this con btw, just mentioning it to be fair.- 64Gig SSD ~ I must admit, I hate 64G because windows alone takes up 30G.  128 is really the tablet sweet spot I'm looking for but since this only has 64 I bought a WD 1TB external - now I have plenty of room.  ;)Overall - I'm just sad it took me so long to find this!  Although I'm sure waiting got me through the various incompatibility points other reviewers have talked about.  If you want a very efficient work productivity tool that can still play movies/games this is a solid purchase.There's nothing like typing one minute, picking up the screen and writing down some drawings, then putting the screen back and using the included keyboard and a wireless mouse to play a game.Careful though, IPad lovers will be jealous and start stalking you!Update: 6 month markPretty much just over the top 'it keeps getting better' as I learn the nuances of working with the device.-Power: Do not be afraid of 'sleep' mode.  The tablet wakes up in 5 seconds - I've gone all day in a corporate environment one a single charge just using sleep judiciously, and without the slightest work interrupt.  A key reminder is to turn wireless/bluetooth off unless you need them, huge power save.-Charging: charges much faster than a laptop or iDevice ~ I go from zero to full in under half an hour (not a scientific experiment, but practical usage), I have an extra charger in my desk, use it on the train in at 7, can run all over, drop it at lunch at 12, and then still have 50% when I hit the train to go home at 6.-Disk space: I just started experimenting with the SD slot with a 64G SD card.  Just fantastic, hot swappable D drives, love it!  Downside - SD slot usage drains power!  Enough to notice, say take 4 hrs of useful life down to 3.5 so its noticeable but totally worth it.  If you're in a corp env, pop out your SD card, put the filler and and swap when you're back at the hotel.-Hardware: Awesome hardware, I just installed some new gen games and I can flip between a game, itunes, onenote, office, and RDP just seamlessly ~ a very multi-use device that still meets current high end software requirements.-Device size: LOVE the screen real-estate.

The CPU is okay for day to day activities but you can forget watching HD videos (that's if you like your movies littered with lag spikes and slow downs). ANY sort of gaming fails on it and I mean any, not even Counter-Strike or Quake III, games made circa 9/11 run smoothly on it at 640x480 as well as all newer games. Music production also is very limited on this guy as a few instances of the most basic of VSTs, a few Kontakt instruments and some convolution will send it flying to >75% CPU usage in FL Studio 11. It can't even handle recording from my Presonus USB Audiobox without huge pops and delays. The USB port covers will break your nails trying to pry them open, the screen developed yellow splotches around the edges of screen and it will sometimes start tapping/clicking repeatedly the top right hand corner of the screen, the bluetooth module stopped working all together alongside, the micro-HDMI no longer is detected on monitors/TVs and the headphone jack reverted to mono output shortly after I bought it. The turbo boost feature also never fails to turn on when I least need it and only makes an appearance on boot up or when I'm hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL. The only redeeming features were the quick SSD, stylus capabilities which helped me with my studies tremendously and the adequate ram.

I was so excited when I read about the Wacom pen with pressure sensitivity, and the fact that it ran on Windows 7 so I could install my Photoshop, Zbrush and other painting software without having to switch to Windows 8. I thought I would be able to sketch, draw and paint anywhere!The truth is, I can... but in all honestly, it's difficult enough on this tablet that I don't really feel like it's worth the frustration. When I was doing my research on the tablet, I didn't take into consideration the fact that there aren't any of the buttons that I am accustomed to on my Intuos 4 drawing tablet. I understand that these types of tablets usually rely on the touch input, or at least a stylus, and have no buttons, and I was prepared to deal with that -- I didn't really consider how difficult this would make it to perform all those countless tasks that I need to in photoshop that I usually use the buttons for. While painting, it's difficult to zoom, pan and rotate the canvas, and though rotation is less necessary (since I can just rotate the tablet itself) I still need to be able to pan and zoom a lot so I can get in there and work all those nitty gritty details. And if I use the bluetooth keyboard that comes with the device to input commands, it goes to sleep way too fast, so every time I need to name a layer, undo a brush stroke, or use transformation tools, I had to wait for it to reconnect to the tablet. On top of that, the Wacom driver seems to be constantly overruled by the Windows \"Pen and Touch\" program (which is difficult to disable, and if you do your touch screen won't work anymore), and the Wacom drivers that you have to download in order for the pressure sensitivity to work seems to freeze or crash way too often.Bottom line... it is a good idea. I really still can't wait for a portable tablet that gives me even half the amount of functionality that my Intuos 4 does. This Asus tablet is close, but just not close enough. I was so excited and I couldn't wait for the tablet to arrive, but now that I've got it and tested it out for a while, I just feel a little disappointed.

Because of this, I was using the tablet  once every few weeks to access flash player content that I cannot access with my iPad, and also install the never-ending Windows updates.Last week, the power did not turn on and the charging  light was also off. The charger's own light was on. I bought a replacement charger with cables, just in case, on the advice of Geeksquad repair service, but it  did not work. I called Asus support, they told me to press the power button for 30 secs, without the charger, no go. They said they will call me back, never did. I called again today, they asked me to do same thing, did not work. They gave me an RMA number to ship the device  at my expense. When they get it they will call me about the cost of the repair. I am wondering whether I should toss this tablet, since it is not very useful to me, although it cost over $1000, rather than paying for repairs and two-way shipping. I can save that money for the new Microsoft tablet with Windows 8, may be. An Internet search showed some \"do it yourself\" solutions (open slate, disconnect battery, press reset hole) that did not work for me.Apart from the phantom clicks, I really liked the tablet for casual browsing  when it worked! Although the tablet is out of warranty, I only used it very few times, it should not have failed with such little use.UPDATE July 5, 2012After writing the above review, I decided to send the device to the ASUS repair center in Texas by cheapest courier service, no insurance.  After a few business days from the day of delivery, I called the repair center and I was told that my slate was fixed and already on its way back! I was told that they changed a component. I just received it and the packing slip specified the component as  90R-OK02MB1000Q.  The slate seems to work now, and I am instaling many Windows updates. The battery is charging. Most importantly, there was no fee for the repair. If the new component does not die as fast as the old one, I would be very happy with the repair.

The full windows 7 load is great, it does more than any ipad could ever dream of.However, Windows 7 is not optimized for touch. I thought that this wouldn't be a big deal, but some targets are truly difficult to touch with a finger, and the pen/touch keyboard don't always play nice. If you're tech savvy enough to troubleshoot most problems, this is a fun toy, and I love being able to show/do work right in the crook of my arm.The keyboard that came with the machine works well, and i have not yet had a problem with it. It pairs quickly after it on, and is comfortable to type with.I would give this five stars, but I do have a few concerns with the slate.1. Limited storage - I bought a 128 gb SDXC card to offset the 64gb internal drive that came in the model i bought.2. Drivers - needs drivers for touch sensitivity in photoshop, and wouldn't pair with my HTC Evo 4G.3. Pen - has no right click. You can press and hold for right click options but this doesn't always work wellA few side notes:I bought an invisible shield screen protector that was designed for this product, and it almost negates the touch screen. I could not log in via the touch screen keyboard once I placed the protector on the screen. I plan on returning it.If you really plan on using the pen, you'll need one with a right click button. Unfortunately, they won't fit in the onboard storage bay.You may want to purchase a bluetooth mouse. Sometimes touch isn't fun. As I said... small targets. We'll see how windows 8 changes this.There are not a lot of options for you once you buy this product. Really no other cases besides the one included fit the ep 121.You may want to buy a USB optical (DVD/CD/Blu-Ray) drive. The refresh discs come with the product... but there is no way to read them. So silly. Send me a USB stick with the stuff on it.I am very impressed with how fast this thing is. I considered overclocking it, but it runs just fine for now. I may do so in the future.I have also seen a few modifications online that can allow you to change the function associated with the \"home\" button. I recommend looking into how to change the button to turn on and off touch finger input, as it \"vectors out\" if you touch your hand to the screen prior to the pen.The jury is still out for me, i've only had the machine for a week.

I started looking at the 7 and 9 inch tablets but they are too small to actually work on.  I went back to a laptop as the prices were reasonable and the performance was there but still I wanted a tablet.  I keep things a long time, so I wanted something that would last me through a few upgrades of the OS.  Looking at the Asus Transformer and the Dell tablet / keyboard neither really was exactly what I wanted.  Then I found this on line.  The reviews were mostly good, the hands on videos were impressive, so I got one yesterday and I could not be happier.Pros:- it boots super fast thanks to the solid state drive- the processing speed is impressive, even when multi-multi tasking, thanks to the dual core i5- the weight is next to nothing compared to the concrete block of a laptop I came from- the cost is comparable with similar laptops- plugged in or in high res mode the screen is ultra clear- use handwriting with stylus, Blue-tooth keyboard or on-screen keyboardCons:- battery life is as stated UNLESS you actually need to see the screen.  In battery only mode the screen dims to save power and if you push it back up to max, the batter life is actually about 2.5-3 hours while using it.  Sleep mode saves on this if you are not working on it full tilt.- the USB slot covers take an act of congress to get out, finally wound up using a screwdriver, maybe they will ease over time so that you can do it with your fingernail.Overall:This is a great tool for work and play.

While it is expensive it is all of then functions really well, rather than only a few. In that regard, I only had to purchase one device instead of at least 3 purchases (tablet, laptop, and Wacom pen).On purchasing it, I also installed Zune, Office Professional, Amazon Kindle for PC, Comical (a comic book reader), and Skype. I also updated all the software and drivers (including manually updating the Wacom pen drivers from Asus.com). I even setup the Bluetooth keyboard with is trouble. Finally I made all my customizations-hid all desktop icons, turned on clock gadget, weather gadget, installed live calendar gadget, synced windows live account, and picked out a theme from the online gallery. Seems like a lot of work, but it is worth it to me.As to the specs:Os (Windows 7 Home Premium): One great feature is having a real operating system. Long before there was an App that, there were a lot of programs available some so nice you would shell out a lot of cash for Well they are all available. The big ones for me on this are Office and Photoshop.. Though I have to wait on the latter. Additionally, I can home network with my desktop which runs Windows7. Then there are a couple of great surprises. The pen can enter handwriting and convert it to text everything here was entered that way. It is also useful in OneNote because I can write and draw pictures like I'm in a real notebook. There is also pretty fantastic Speech Recognition, that will dictate a letter or open a program.Screen Resolution: I have read many people's complaints about how resolution on this monitor. I can only disagree. I believe this must be based on the current trend of ultra high resolution cell phones. I would like to explain just a few things. First a WXGA (1280\u00d7800) LCD monitor is considered HD. Second, the complaint is based on the pixel density, or the number of pixels available per square inch. The density on a normal monitor is ~100 PPI. The density on this monitor is 124.75 PPI. An Ipad2 is 1024x768 (9.7\") or 132 PPI. If you have never complained about these monitors and are not interested in paying 2 or 3 thousand dollars for the device, you will not complain about this feature.Process and memory: It has a Intel Dual-Core i5 470um with 4GB DDR3, 1 x SO-DIMM. It is a 64 bit processor. It is fast enough that I really don't see any delays. The one possible complaint is turning the screen switches its orientation and it goes black for one second instead of harm an animation.Storage: It has a 64 GB BSD. This antiquates to the speed, but it is also not a lot of memory. After all my installs I have used up around 35GB. I did give myself an extra 32GB by using the SD card set with a memory card from an old phone. Abs, MS gives you 25GB online storage and 5GB synced stage at skydrive.live.com. If that isn't enough Asus has more available with l year free trial of online storage at their website (50OGB). So while it is more than my old 8063 laptop, it is shallow on space compared to others without extras.Connectivity: WiFi and Bluetooth works as expected. No cellular service, but I was not looking.Camera and Audio: I have had issue with some Asus webcams before , but none here. Crisp without delay. The audio is stereo and fine for a laptop.Battery: Listed as 4.5 hrs. With more demanding settings, I get around 3-4 hrs of normal use. It charges without any trouble-even in use.Extras: It comes. With several useful ports (2 x USB 2.0 port, Audio Jack, mini HDMI port, and MMC/ SD(SDHC/SDXC) Card Reader). In short, you can plug a couple USB devices in, hook it up to you TV, and either expand the available memory or look at photos from a camera. If that's not enough, it comes with a Bluetooth keyboard, a pressure sensitive pen, and a case - that let you work like a pen and paper, improves navigation, and lets you pretend you are on a regular laptop, but you are on something better. I bought a Bluetooth mouse, thinking it would make navigation easier, but I never use it.Summary: This is not a typical tablet-it is a real computer. It can perform as well as a laptop, has nice drawing features, and is very portable. I love it. When factoring in all my desires, it is a good deal. I had good surprises only. The biggest downside to me is the limited stage, but it is manageable. The battery life is shorter than a tablet, but this is a slate computer, and it is acceptable. The pen works fantastically. Beware your friends will all be jealous.If you decide to purchase one, do yourself a favor-go to Asus.com and find the updated pen drivers here[...]They are listed as \"Wacon ISD_DualTouch_V7.0.2-21\" at this time. If you don't you could, have a problem with the screen not responding after significant use...So far I am perfectly happy in spite of the small storage capacity.UPDATE: I updated to Windows 8 Pro essentially when the update was available back in October or November. I had one issue early on with an update not making it through and another almost immediately with the side buttons. The first was resolved by Microsoft early on. The second was resolved by updating the drivers/software. All of that is available on Asus's website.I am very pleased with the update. The update definitely improves the speed of the computer, especially with boot and wake up times. New interface with the start menu is more convenient and less clutsy for touch than the Windows 7 interface. I liked it so much I updated my desktop (which doesn't have touch).

Comparing the Asus to the old Fujitsu: - the Asus is ~1 lb. lighter and slightly thinner, very important when carrying the tablet much of the day - it doesn't get warm like the Fujitsu, also very important when you are carrying it and resting it against your forearm while writing on the screen - it has a significantly brighter screen with higher resolution - it boots up incredibly faster - the battery life is about the same, roughly 3 hours.  Unfortunately, it doesn't allow the battery to be changed, like the Fujitsu - it is much easier to use; the old Fujitsu had several buttons and manual switching from portrait to landscape displayThe Windows 7 user interface is not optimized for touchscreen use, which sometimes makes it difficult to activate onscreen buttons, etc.  Also, the two-finger touch control (e.g., zooming, rotating, etc) works well most of the time, but not as smoothly as iPads.  Handwriting recognition with Windows 7 has improved compared with Windows Vista, but still benefits from training.  The most frequent and frustrating problem noted so far when handwriting is that palm rejection on the screen is not as effective as I would like.  If the next release of Windows is optimized for tablet/touchscreen computers it will be an enormous improvement.The computer boots up unbelievably quickly.  The computer runs very fast with Windows Office, internet, videos, etc. For most clinical work, a 12\" screen size is essential; I would advise against anthing smaller.  I like the locations of input/output ports and the few switches.  The pop-out writing pen is convenient, but I liked the tether my old Fujitsu had which kept the pen from getting misplaced.  Audio is quite good, both from the speakers and with headsets.The fact that the Asus comes with a nice leather case is a plus, because I travel a great deal.  It can also be used to prop the tablet into three different positions for viewing.  The Bluetooth keyboard provided with the Asus is compact and slim enough to slip into my briefcase. Adding a mini Bluetooth mouse allows me to replace my laptop, especially when traveling.  The power cord has a USB port to charge USB devices - a nice feature.

The keyboard is a bit clunky to carry around, and runs through battery pretty quickly, but works fine for at-home paper writing.

The screen had to be good resolution too since that's key for tablets... viewing angles, sunlight, etc..I eventually narrowed my results down to the EXOPC, which i fell in love with immediately and the EP121.

There are a few glitches, like stuff i wrote would get erased for no particular reason , but there is always the undo button.4) ASUS support - very prompt and responsiveBad:1) Bluetooth keyboard stopped working after 20 days. And its hard to be productive without a bluetooth keyboard with this tablet PC. If you are working on a report or anything that needs typing - typing on soft keyboard is hard. There is no tactile feedback and there is a slight lag in response of keys to touch, which makes typing very fast impossible. Also you mistype if your palm touches some other keys unintentionally2) Windows 7 is still not 100% tablet friendly, as not all tools respond to touch very well. I had to change the tool bar location multiple times as things would get pressed and applications started, while taking notes on one-note, or the tool bar would hide the keyboard prompt.3) Login is a pain after sleep mode, a fingerprint reader will be helpful.4) Battery life is low. less than 3 hours is not acceptable5) 64GB SSD is too small. half of it is used by OS and other stuff that comes preloaded.6) The stylus is easy to lose and replacement is hard to find.I might take a second look at this laptop after it becomes mainstream and has these additional features of1) Fingerprint reader2) Sandy Bridge processor with very long battery life3) GPS4) 3G/4G connectivity option5) better touch control (but this is on the OS side)", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best slate i have seen", "Author": "R.

The windows 7 with slate is not totally perfect, somethings you click other things that you did not want to but is good enough. The best slate to make drawing with the digitizer pen. I totally recommend the product. I installed a lot of programs and agree that the memory is not enough but i'm planning to buy the Lexar Professional 128 GB 133x SDXC Card. which is going to give me more memory than hopefully i will ever need in a portable computer. I've been playing with this Slate for about two weeks and I can tell you that no problems have been shown so far regard of functionality, speed, or quality. I think Asus is in the right direction, if this is the first generation I cant wait to see the second or third generations. i heard rumors that they released a new windows 7 Slate which has a bottom charger that fits in a dock station, that dock station has a bigger battery, hard disk and keyboard which makes the slate a laptop as well just detaching and attaching the slate to the dock station. I wanted to buy the iPad last year but i have so many windows based programs that i decided to wait, i knew that someone will eventually make a decent windows based slate and the time is right here, this is the one. some people say that this first generation slate is the bad just because is the first one but as a real Asus EP121 buyer i can tell you its just the best, much better that anything on the market so far.UPDATE AS MARCH 17:Lexar just released the 128 GB SD Card. with that baby you will hardly ever need more storage. I personally use the installed 64GB memory for program installation and those confidential documents, pictures and other stuffs i do not want to keep secret. and the 128 GB SD Card for storing the music, videos, movies, etc that usually are more memory consuming. And of course I back up the SD every often with my desk pc which has much more memory[...]", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Defect out of t he box", "Author": "akawache", "ReviewID": "R3UTTQK2XYNN1Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can not really review the actual product this is more a review of ASUS, the tablet was brand new in sealed box, took it out and turned it on and it seemed to turn on by looking at the light on the back and hearing the fan but could not see anything on the screen.

This was very disappointing considering how expensive this is and the fact that it was brand new. I researched online and it seems this is probably due to a backlight problem one user indicated having the same issue and it ended up being a loose cable.

Slim, light (relatively), and with all the features you could want... BUT...Unfortunately, the unit I received appears to suffer from manufacturing/quality defects.  On the first day of significant use, I noticed that after the unit has been on for a few minutes (~15-20), the screen develops *several* areas of discoloration... Blue background appears yellowish; black background has what seems to be a bluish light bleeding through, etc.  The largest area of discoloration is approximately 2 inches by 0.5 inches, so it's definitely 'noticeable'.A second area of concern : I logged a trouble ticket with ASUS, but have received no response (for 5 days now, and counting).  When you pay this much for a tablet, you expect support.Other areas of concern (though more minor than the two listed above):  - The touch screen is out of calibration in the top corner, and I was unable to find any utility for calibrating it.  The mis-calibration is slight... only about 1/4 of an inch, but it is enough to cause you to select the wrong menu item in that corner.  - The Processor speed rating (in the \"Windows Experience Index\" page) is quite slow; slower, in fact, than my 4-year-old Toshiba Tablet with an Intel Core2 Duo processor... that was surprising.  I expected the EP121's Core i5-470 to be somewhat faster, but the \"Windows Experience Index\" assessment sub-score is 3.1 (versus 3.2 for my 4-year-old Core2 Duo).All in all, I was originally quite eager to get my hands on this tablet, but in light of the above, I am now regretting the purchase.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Could have been a contender", "Author": "Dr Arrospide", "ReviewID": "R3CC5DHHCXO62W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I sold my Ipad1 to buy this Tablet.

I rate these 5 stars because of the fact of the innovation involved with this product. A powerful, freakin, computer in a tablet/slate form. Something I have been waiting for years. I grew tired of the tablet alternatives and the closed systems that populate the scene. Granted those competitor devices have matured greatly in their capabilities. Windows slate, though a device of this nature has been around for a while, is a bit late but not out for the count. I can't wait to get my device when it is finally available; I assume I will be using it as another machine in my home and business, just a little bit more mobile.For George Allen Papapetrou , I rated this machine 5 stars on purpose, not because I was being nice but for the reasons above, Because of the modernization of windows 7 in a tablet form.  This product when I receive it may not be perfect, its windows, (a non-touch os with touch ui added on to it) but it is an awesome device. Nothing is every perfect neither am i.

I am not familiar with the review or comment structures that are here in amazon, I'm sorry for my ignorance and I am sorry that my asking of a question of the delivery times with a five star rating promotes abuse within the commenting threads of the product that I bought and feel deserves high marks.

I personally cannot wait until it arrives. I do realize that it may have its faults being it is a windows operating system whose general use was not primarily touch, and maybe based on other reviews of backlight issues (which will be attended too in accord), and finally short battery life, I am sure to find its use and convenience worth the premium.This review was looked over for any offensive comments as i do not want to offend any one as i felt, so heres my bridge", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Highly dissapointed", "Author": "Kelvin", "ReviewID": "RJ7WZT6N2GWL1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This thing is awful.

But I was a bit taken in by the positives, namely the touch screen and obvious use for drawing, all while being able to run Windows 7.  I thought it would be an interesting replacement for my aging 6 year old laptop, and I wanted something really portable.So... I am giving myself one star out of five.  Don't be like me, do a little more research.  I respect most of the five star reviews for this tablet written here by others, but for me I have found that I value a snappier interface, and sometimes this tablet can be very klunky for doing some things without a mouse like copying files or web surfing.  Also, it isn't accurate sometimes, when you are touching graphical components with your finger (like a scrollbar in a webpage).  So if that's the problem why not plug in a mouse and keyboard (or use the bluetooth keyboard)?  If you do that, what you have is a low resolution laptop.  It's kind of a failure.Which brings me to the next gripe: low resolution.  I would've been happier with a smaller screen with a higher dot pitch of resolution, even if it was still the same total resolution, especially if it were more precise with the touch interface.  Even if that meant just supporting the stylus only.It's not a total loss, I like to draw so I'll do some of that, and I'll use the included Microsoft Word for writing.

I know that one note seems to have this awesome feature of converting your manual equation into math equation, but seriously, the program confuses for sigma with E, and it becomes extremely combersome to manually change all the equations to convert them correctly that you took for 50 minutes(it will literally take you extra 1 hour, no kidding).The electronic product, and the one note compatibility, put in best words, are still in developing stage.

It has a beautiful design, simple and useful.Pros- Very easy to use.- Excellent and modern design.- Good sound quality.- Excellent keyboard until... (see my comment below \"After a Year\")- Good Touch screen.- Other applications included like: GPS (using wi-fi), compass, etc.- It has a slot for inserting a celular phone SIM card, however it is not ready to be used. I thing this will be available in the future.- Good colors and screen resolution acceptable.- You can use the computer with the keyboard and the touch screen at the same time. Awesome.- Good webcam included.- This is the few net computers with Windows 7 home edition.- Silent and quite.Cons- Few information of this computer in the DELL site. I hope to have more information from DELL.- Acceptable performance. Nothing too fast, nothing too slow.- When used for long periods tends to generates a bit of heat.- It does not have a flashlight on the keyboard to work at night.- It has a lot of useless DELL software installed, most of them \"LITE\" versions constantly requiring purchase of the full \"PRO\" versions.- USB port cover is not practical to use when the computer is on a flat surface.Other comments:- I like Google Chrome, however for this software the Touch capabilities are not good. I'm using IE 9, it uses the touch screen capabilities in a good way.- I was very dissapointed when I received the computer in a box where you can see in a picture the computer inserted in a Dell station, however when you open the box, you only find your computer alone. The Dell station is sold separately.- Have not a cover included. I bought a Belkin cover.- Strange behavior when the computer enters in Stand by alone. After this, you can listen some \"beeps\" and you need to try starting up the computer with a forced start up.After a year- Problem issue with the keyboard. With a few utilization in general terms of the computer, after one year the keyboard presents problems with the following keys:2, W, Backspace, \\, Enter, PgDn, PgUp and Space.  I run the Support Center Software and it indicates that everything is ok, however, the problem persists. You know, the computer is out of the original warranty.- All the other computer parts are good.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Inspiron Duo, nothing but trouble", "Author": "Lat", "ReviewID": "RTP7QNKDKRYCR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't post reviews on products often but I am so disappointed with this netbook that I've posted three times. I purchased this netbook in May and by August it was no longer working. After having Dell's techs run a diagnostic, going out and getting several independent opinions, Dell admitted several months later that I had a faulty hard drive. They had me send the netbook in for repairs and said they would send it back in 10 days.Guess what? It's been 24 days and counting. They've now told me they don't have the parts to fix my hard drive and they want to give me a refurbished netbook to replace it. After several weeks of complaining they admitted that they are no longer producing hard drives for this netbook. In fact they are no longer producing the netbook at all. According to the tech I spoke with even customers who are currently ordering new Inspiron Duo convertible netbooks will be receiving refurbished units.  I called the Dell sales department to verify and they are now having a clearance sale on this netbook with 'limited' supply.Don't buy this netbook---it really is a shoddy product. Dell has obviously gotten the message that this product is nothing but trouble.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is the absolute worst pc I ever owned", "Author": "Antarctic Dream \"Antarctic Dream\"", "ReviewID": "R1R4BPRMHYHNU2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The design is so attractive , it flips from touch screen to keyboard, I thought I died and went to heaven.3 days latter, for no apparent reason, it slowed down a lot. It was never fast to begin with but from running ok it turned into dead, frozen, not turning on!Dell support team is composed of overseas crew who appear to tink that holding down the on/off button should solve everything.

There are so many reviews on here for the Playbook (all the bad reviews seem to complain about one thing, the amount of APPS, just craziness!), there is not much to be said that has not been said already, so I'll keep this simple, basically give the reasoning behind my decission to go with the Playbook over other Tablets/laptops...  About 4 months back my \"Acer ONE\" laptop crapped out on me, and I've been saving for a new laptop ever since. It's been a hard 4 months, as I have been stuck using my Ipod Touch 1st generation to surf the net while at home, which BTW has NO Youtube or Flash on it (it had Youtube but no longer works on it anymore!)!  Well, about 3 weeks back I finally saved enough and began surfing the net for the best laptop/netbooks on the market.  When I started my search for a new laptop, the only thing I was looking for was a laptop, thats all I had on my mind.  The main things I was looking for was a fast browser, the laptop/netbook must be small (9 to 10-inch screen or so) for potability, a decent amount of memory, a nice camera, and must be powerful enough to play movies and stream content without glitching up on me.  While researching a couple weeks back, I decided to take a look at Tablets, thinking to myself that something like my Ipod but with a bigger screen would be absolutly perfect for what I was looking for!  I must have looked at every Tablet on the market before deciding on the Playbook (The Acer Iconia, Moto Xoom, Ipad 2, etc), I even went to Best Buy just to test them all out, and in the end it was a no-brainer, the Blackberry was the Tablet for me.  While there are some good Tablets at a cheaper price then the Blackberry, the main advantage the Blackberry has over them is Power, the camera/video (1080p video recording), the OS interface, browser speed, the size (portability), and more Power!  I was amazed at the OS on this tablet, it is AMAZING!!!  My favorit feature of this is to wake up the Blackberry, you simply swipe from the top edge down, and it turns on the Playbook! While there is a button to press inorder to turn off/on, you do NOT need it, a simple swipe of the screen does everything now (watch some of the Blackberry Interface video's on Youtube, you will see the beauty of the OS in it's full glory!)!  I can now record video's in full 1080p and watch them on my TV with micro HDMI connection (only $5 bucks for a micro HDMI cord here on Amazon), when I am at home I surf the web on my 46-inch Samsung HD LCD Screen through my Blackberry Playbook, I watch movies, etc, all on my TV! :) I can now take wonderful Pics where ever I am without my Samsung Camera on me, the Playbook does it all!  This Tablet is tiny, but the screen is sooo perfect in size, it is bigger then I expected!  I was thinking that the screen was gonna be just a tad bigger then my Ipod Touch screen, NO SO!  It looks more like 4 Ipod Touch screens put together, just the perfect size to read and watch movie's without having to squint. I am not a big app freak (never been), so the apps that this Playbook does have suit me just fine (Although RIM has stated they are adding apps daily, this is there first Tablet, so I do give RIM the benifit here).  My goal now is to get me a Blackberry phone with a Internet plan, this way I will be able to \"Bridge\" the phone to the Playbook \"at NO cost\" and go on the internet on my Playbook anywhere there is a Cell Phone signal, so my fiance can be driving down the highway and I can be surfing the web sitting right next to her! :  The awesome thing about this is you do not have to pay for a seperate plan for the Playbook, you simply buy the plan for your phone and Bridge the connection to your Playbook, and BINGO, internet everywhere! :D  I also bought a \"Defender Case\" for my Blackberry Playbook, this case protects like you would not believe! If you decide to get this awesome Playbook, the Defender case is the only way to go!  This case is sooo tuff, You can run over the Playbook with a car and there won't be a sctratch on it!  Look up \"Defender case for Blackberry Playbook\" here on Amazon, and check the reviews. There are also video's on Youtube which shows the strenght of this case. There is nothing better then this case to protect your investment.  With all this said, I am beyond happy with my Playbook, I could not be happier!

Do a search on the internet on how people use their Ipads. I am sure this is true for other devices.What I like about the Playbook over the Ipad,1. Multi Tasking2. Gestures (no constant pressing a button to change apps)3. Blackberry Bridge (with my bold connected it is superb)4. HDMI output - this works great with any TV, it uses the full screen (not like IPad) no extra accessories (only cable, not like the Ipad) it can also use the Bold's touch screen and keypad for input.5. The size - Ipad have just woke up to this with the Ipad Mini.6. The build - as good as the Ipad if not better.7. The price - recent discounting gives you 4 64gb Plybooks for 1 64gb Ipad.8. The mini usb port far more friendly that the Ipad (Apple cannot even stick to one format).I think the Ipad is great but has it limitation, the Playbook is great and combined with a BlackBerry Bold it is a great business tool.On balance I think the Playbook wins out just on the points above but I am always open to persuasion.I hope this helps anyone wanting to choose.I have not mentioned the Nexus 7 but it is good and a treat for those that like to change things all the time, with the correct firmware it is the fastest tablet, but not for the faint hearted.Also if you want to see what the playbook can achieve go here and have a look at the video not an Ipad in site in the Porsche  [...]", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Recommended", "Author": "Zagain", "ReviewID": "R3CMMSDGC8NY1O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Overall, I would not recommend this product.  I recently purchased it because, at the price, it seems like a great deal.  You get 64GB of storage (a similarly priced Android tablet would have 8 or 16GB), and the hardware platform is similar to other 7\" Android tablets.  I was aware that the app store would have far fewer options available than what one would find in Google Play or Apple's store, but to be fair, there were quite a few options for games and other tools.  The unfortunate thing is that the unit arrived partially charged and would not allow me to recharge the battery with either the provided power adapter or the USB cable.  After doing some quick searching on Google, I found that a number of people experienced this problem -- either after first opening the product or after using it for a year.  Another negative is that the tablet has a very long boot up process.  I actually thought on initial boot that it was simply stuck on the initial BlackBerry screen given how long it took, but it eventually started.  I then assumed that this was probably just a delay due to it being the very first startup, but on a restart I found that it was the same thing.So, overall, I would urge caution in purchasing the tablet.On the positive side, it's got good hardware, great storage capacity, and some obvious software advantages for BlackBerry users.  Additionally, while it may not have the selection of apps and games that you may find for iOS or Android, it's not as if the store was completely empty with choices either.On the negative side, however, I find it hard to \"trust\" the device as it seems the ability to recharge is a common problem.  Additionally (and others have mentioned), BlackBerry is obviously abandoning their tablet line, so the long-term prospects for the device aren't great -- but if you can get one that works (and recharges), I'm sure it's fine for many uses.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a GREAT tablet for your Dolla'...!!!", "Author": "Vincent Aumann", "ReviewID": "R2QIRN2XVX537E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A GREAT Tablet for your Dolla'...! I have been playing around with this thing for the past week or two, and this tablet is nice! It is a solid built tablet, with a nice \"rubberized/coated\" backing to keep it from slipping out of your hand. The weight is there, knowing you have something in your hand which I like, due in part by it being a LCD tablet, and not a LED tablet like iPADs and such.Like the iPADs out there, it does not have the MicroSD/SD slot for expanding memory and such. However, getting 64GB of memory compared to an iPAD Mini w/ 16GB of memory, for HALF the price! For me.... that's a \"no brainer\".Also, it comes w/ at least 1GB of RAM & a 1.2GHz processor, and I believe.... iPAD Mini is 512MB of RAM? REALLY... I hate to say this, but it's time for the \"Fruity Named\" I.T. company to upgrade their hardware. They are way behind in that area, yet... charge the most money for their products.Anyway, the O/S is very smooth & simple to figure out. Took me 10 minutes to get the jist of how it works, and have now gotten quite competent rolling through it for all the uses I need for it. I have let this thing stay on, with the WiFi on until it drains to zero, with periodic use - this BB Playbook EASILY lasted 24 hrs before I went and charged it back up. (NOTE - if you use the cellular on it, music, video, it will be less) I play a LOT of music thru the WiFi, and it lasted a good 8 to 10 hrs.Other little nuances to note:1)the fact you can \"Pause\" applications in the background OR have ALL of them active. I pause them, so this is probably why the battery will last longer than maybe for other people.2) there's desktop software to download (free), so you can transfer files between computer & Playbook, and this is very handy!3) Having HDMI is nice when wanting to surf/watch a vid on my big screen TV instead.4) Touch KYBD on the Playbook is nice to type on for a 7 incher. Adjusting the sensitivity of the touch screen KYBD is simple.5) Quite impressive sound quality on the dual speakers AND when listen thru the headphones AND listening it thru my AUX jack in my car stereo.6) The BB Playbook takes surprisingly decent pictures & video. (5MP rear / 3MP front)So if you're looking for an easy, simple, more money for your buck tablet - Get the BB Playbook. I use it for music, writing lyrics, reading documents, and general surfing of the web for the most part. I don't need a full blown laptop for on the go, nor paying the high price of other tablets out there. However, I wanted the closest thing to \"professional grade\" (NOT Consumer grade) I could get, w/o the huge 'professional price', and this tablet just makes things bit more convenient for me.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I hope blackberry stays in the tablet game", "Author": "Damnyankee \"Cygnus X-1\"", "ReviewID": "R2US3LGJQQORSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a screamin deal. 64G , great screen, nice weight, feels good, looks good.

The 1080p HD display is stunning!  Other tablets have fancy names for their display, this one delivers true 1080P HD video.  The Operating System is a true multi-tasking OS, so you can run numerous apps simultaneously.  Play music while browsing the Internet, while you have Excel open working on your spreadsheet... just like on a personal desktop computer.  The built-in wireless lets me connect to my home or corporate network with ease, as well as hot-spots, and browse the web with speed.  There's even a Remote Desktop app so you can log on to other computers on your network.Speaking of the web, the BB Playbook has a real web browser with Adobe PDF reader, HTML5, Flash, and everything else you need to browse the web.  This is a true tabbed browser, letting you open multiple pages in tabs, just like on your home PC. The Favorites page has thumbnails/logos of each page.  The built-in speakers have surprisingly good sound, although you probably want bluetooth or wired speakers if you're going to be listening live in your living room, and earphones for personal use.The BB Playbook has USB 2 and HDMI ports, so you can use the Playbook to drive a large screen HDTV by using an HDMI cable.  Even more than that, you can use your Blackberry smart phone as a remote control device/mouse.  Hook the Playbook to your big screen, use you BB smartphone as a mouse, and you have an instant presentation machine, using the built-in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint or PDF, web browser, e-amil, YouTube or whatever you want.  You can also open files that are on your BB smartphone directly on the Playbook!  Transferring files from my PC to the BB Playbook is a snap, you just use Windows to transfer the files from your local Documents or Library to the Playbook network Public folder - drag and drop, nothing to it.It has a native e-mail app that I use for my Yahoo! and Hotmail accounts, and I use BB Bridge to connect to my corporate Exchange mailbox.  The Playbook also has Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, so you can connect the native e-mail app directly to your corporate mail.After only a week, we have been using it for:-tracking medications-creating spreadsheets (such as home inventory)-email (3 separate accounts) and web browsing-youtube player-online shopping-music player & video player-alarm clock and timer-eBook reader-apps: Resistor color codes, audio sinewave generator, eBook reader (native), piano player, various social games, dictionary, Bible w/ text and text-to-speech.There are also good speech to text and text to speech aps.Unlike some popular tablets, this tablet is not merely a web browser/email reader, Angry Birds player, or some toy to keep your kids or cats occupied, it's a real personal and business productivity machine.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing.

Unfortunately it was locked in demo mode so I had to exchange it,but they didn't have any left in stock.One very important thing I want to say is that don't think the tablet is dead if it doesn't turn on when you get.I thought mine was dead at first, but apparently the software doesn't let it turn on if the battery is drainedto less than 10 or 20%. It takes about 2 hours to charge it to get it to 20%. Some people have also said thatthe battery dies when you drain it completely... that's because lithium ion batteries aren't like alkalinebatteries and it's not good to completely discharge them.PROSThis is using original operating system version 1.0.7 Bundle 2942 that came with it, not eventhe latest 2.0.1 Bundle 358 update.-Comes with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint preinstalled. I'm not sure how useful this would be for professionalssince the tablet doesn't have 3G, but if you have a Blackberry phone and use the bridge, it seems like it could be very useful.-Browser has only crashed twice using it for about 3 hours a day for 10 days. Not bad at all. Once it crashesyou can turn it back on immediately.-I easily had 5 tabs open in the browser, 2 of them videos but didn't try more. The 1Gb of ram helps a lot with multitasking.-Amazing Wifi: Browser confirmed download speed of 100 KBPS compared to 80KBPS on both desktops and a laptop whichI thought was pretty strange. The browser must have have a built in download accelerator or somethingbut I'm pretty sure my internet shouldn't go faster than 80kbps. I always have full connection.- 3.5-4 minutes/1% battery when watching videos, 5.5-6 minutes/1% whenbrowsing/listening to music, apparently 4- 4.2 minutes if just reading and brightness at 50%The brightness at 10-30% is more than enough. When I set it to 100% it literally hurts my eyes it's so bright.-OS 2.0 apparently lets you download a lot of android apps.-Amazing screen, some things look like they're 3-d. More than sufficient brightness, super black blacks,no dead pixels,very even brightness. The resolution is also very good, both text and video are super crisp.-Great touchscreen responsiveness, pinch to zoom features, and hold a link to right click.-Very stiff case, it's very hard to twist-Thin and light, doesn't get hot, not more than 90 to 100 Fahrenheit-The keyboard is amazing, and the size of the tablets lets me type with both fingers even in landscape mode,although that wouldn't be comfortable for a long period of time-True multitasking with the UNIX based Blackberry OS, unlike IOS and other operating systems.You can leave the camera on, a game on in the background, music on, all while browsing the internet.-Good weight, feels solid but not too heavy at all-Can bridge with Blackberry smart phones (I haven't used this feature).-Pretty decent speakers, can get pretty loud.CONS-Biggest con for me is that the Blackberry desktop software just doesn't work. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling at least 5 times,but it never downloads over 60%. If you try to upload on the tablet directly it also cuts off, saying the internet connectionmight have been interrupted but it hadn't been. Most download managers would automatically pause if the wifi got disconnected,not start completely over again. Very annoying.-Takes 3-5 seconds to switch from portrait to landscape mode once you rotate it, not a big deal for me though-Takes 60 to 80 seconds (average 65) to turn on if off for more than 30 minutes. The good thingis it's functional immediately after it turns on.-15 increments of volume adjustment, but I always felt like it was too quiet or too loud (with headphones on) I have very sensitive ears though.-Most camera pics look grainy, white light pics look much less grainy though. When you upload the pics to your computerthere'll be a lot of pixels, but a lot of them are just noise.-When the battery is charged to 90 to 95% capacity it takes a very long time to charge to 100- about 1 hour from 90 to 100Once above 20% it takes 3 to 4 hours to fully charge. 2 hours from 0-20%-Only 13.4 GBs of usable space, but my whole music collection is about 5 GBs and I don't plan on putting a lot of movies on the tablet.-Can't expand memory because of no SD card slot.Overall, for me, the pros dramatically outweigh the cons.This is the review that convinced me to buy this: check out the review on notebookcheck dot netI pretty much agree with everything stated here.One tip I have is to charge the battery to around 95% and only let it drain to 70%. This maximizes the life of the battery. For me, this gave about2 to 3 hours of time between charges. This is because of the nature of the lithium ion battery in the tablet.Search lithium ion batteries at batteryuniversity dot com", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Highly Underestimated Tablet", "Author": "Elle", "ReviewID": "R101Q9BHGSZVJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great tablet. Let me break it down and explainPROsSIZE: The 7\" form factor is great, it is highly portable. I havent left it at home really since i got it. i'm not one to walk with a big bag, so this is great to drop into your purse or jacket/pants pockets (if you're a guy) It is very solid. So it's great for reading books as well.GESTURES: the playbook uses gestures to turn it on, change applications, and so on.. as there are no buttons on it except for the power and volume buttons. This has to be my FAVOURITE feature.. so ingenious! I own an ipod touch, now i find myself swiping on that screen. lolTRUE MULTITASKER: beauty about this tablet, you can run one application and simply swipe across to get to the other without stopping the first one.. pretty cool. I havent seen any lag on it, i have gotten up to 9 applications going at the same time and it still didnt slow down.BRIDGE: If you own a Blackberry smartphone, it will skyrocket the PB into more awesomeness. With the Bridge function, you can connect your phone with the playbook and use the phone's data plan to surf the internet on the playbook. Big help if there's no wifi around. You can also see a lot of information that's on the phone on the playbook. you can use BB messenger, memopad, calendar, messages (emails) on the playbook.FULL BROWSER WITH FLASH SUPPORT: when browsing, all flash material comes through just like you would on a computer. My mother is able to even check her farmville on it when she's in bed. Though it is laggy, but it will do the job.MEDIA- CAMERA: 3 MP forward facing, 5 MP rear; both capture Full HD 1080p video. you can get some beautiful photos and video. the mics are crisp and clear and loud.- SPEAKERS: 2 speakers on top of either ends of the tablet. They are nice and loud.- DISPLAY: 1024 x 600-pixel resolution. for the size of the tablet, videos looks great. very sharp and crispFUTURE OS: I'm pretty sure BB10 operating system will come to the playbook which will just make the playbook a whole new device again... as i witnessed with Playbook OS 2.0CONS:APPS: In truth, the Blackberry Appworld doesnt have a big apps market like the others have. But many times, the browser does well to access the website. (other tablets create apps because they dont have the flash support and isnt able to use the full website on it)There is no Netflix nor Skype app available, though there are apps that try to get around that. As far as i know, Netflix will not get to the Playbook neither. These dont affect me much because i dont have a netflix subscription and i dont use Skype.Some apps on the PB also tend to be a bit more pricey in comparison. The appstore is growing though so this con may do a turnaround at some point.WEIGHT: For it's size, it's kinda heavy and you can feel it in your hands after a bit. (especially when reading)Overall, I love the PB, i find more uses for it everyday. I find most people who complain about and sully the good name of the playbook didnt do their research... Take heed of what you're buying..  because if you want netflix and skype and a bunch of apps...dont get it and begin to complain that it doesnt have it.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "At $199, the playbook is definitely worth it!", "Author": "Ver de Guzman \"Ver\"", "ReviewID": "R1XRETVZLCVJS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At $499, the BB playbook is a total rip off!

Most apps are paid, very few ones are free2) Camera has no flash (but not a big deal for me)3) No native twitter app. Browser only4) The bezel is just too thick for my taste but I can get over it5) Hangs once in a while and had to reboot to get it working6) Reboot time is quite long, a lot longer than android/iosIn conclusion, despite having equal number of pros and cons, this is still a great buy and I still recommend it for those who wants to use they tabs for social media, videos and emails.

Gibson", "ReviewID": "R3702WLQJ2R53W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided on this tablet as a last minute Christmas gift during the fire sale that was offered by a name brand electronics store toward the end of December.  Yes I read the reviews about how the tablet was good but wasn't \"ready for prime time\" blah blah but with competing models running more than twice the cost I figured, why not?  You can also read a myriad of critcisim on it suggesting how it can't be any good because of its app shortcomings and you'll need to wait until OS 2.0 for it to be anywhere near competative.  Anyone remember waiting for iOS 1.1.5 or even 2.0 on your IPhone to address bugs, push e-mail, etc?  Guess that's ok though... sheesh.I've had it now for about a week and have gotten very used to the form and feel of it as a whole.  It's solidly built and feels good in your hands.  Overall, I'd say RIM has the makings of a huge winner and here's why:Performance - Simply unbelievable.  Multi-tasking is flawless.  Play an HD video, surf the web, open a few documents, the thing won't skip a beat.  The interface is a pleasure to use with bezel gesturing for simple commands.  Want to minimize your app?  Swipe from the bottom bezel upward through the screen.  Want to bring down the options bar?  Swipe from the top bezel down.  Similar functions for scrolling and moving through apps in multi-tasking mode can be done from the left and right as well.  There's also diagonal bezel swiping to bring up things like the keypad, status bar etc.  Oh, and these functions are also mirrored whether you hold the tablet in portrait or landscape.  Really cool.Graphic diplay - Beautiful.  Rich full colors with nice high definition.  Love it.Customization - Good but needs a little work.  I'm hoping that OS 2.0 will address this.  Right now, you can move icons into different pre set categories for 'Games' 'Media' 'Blackberry Bridge' etc. but currently there's no way to setup your own.  Really a minor gripe but there it is.  There's also no sound customization beeps and boops but I'm not sure that's even a necessity. After all, it doesn't have a ringer does it? Of course, you can change wallpaper and all of the typical stuff that goes with that.Apps - One of the biggest complaints with this has been the lack of apps.  They add more by the day on Blackberry App World and with guaranteed Android support in OS 2.0 I have no doubt I'll be downloading a plethora of fart apps in another month or two.  Can't wait (sarcasm intended).Compatability - Android coming in OS 2.0, currently supports flash, HTML5, Plays MP3s, WMA, and I'm sure others.  Can't comment on video format or other audio format yet as I haven't tried those but I can't imagine that others that might not be supported yet won't be soon.Video - Records in 1080p and outputs the same by micro HDMI to your HDMI TV.  Simply awesome.  The thing can also mirror its display on your television for a much richer viewing experience.Camera - Dual cameras fore and aft.  5mp rear and 3mp (I think) front.  Has a video chat function which I haven't tried yet since currently, it only works with other Playbook users.  I understand that there might be third party apps that can be used so that may not be an issue.  Pic quality is about what you'd expect.  Not that it's bad, it's not, it just isn't that good in low light conditions.  I know, what do you expect, right?  With a well lit subject, it's fantastic but just a slight low light condition and it gets grainy.  The Playbook does not have a camera flash which is a particular gripe of mine.  However, since this isn't a primary camera for me or my family, maybe it's not such a concern after all.  Still deciding on that one.  Camera settings are a little lame too.  Auto, Whiteboard, and Sports.  There's also a stabilization button but not much else.Form factor - Love, repeat, love the 7\" screen.  You can put the tablet in your pocket, carry it around with you easily and read text very very well.Bridging - Another criticism of the tablet is that it accuses RIM of only catering to current Blackberry phone owners by not providing native communications software for e-mailing, texting, calendar, etc.  I would have to agree with this one and consider this to be  RIMs biggest mistake which likely helped lead to poor market sales.  I do use a Blackberry so this doesn't affect me but OS 2.0 is supposed to incorporate all of the native ware that everyone is he*l bent on.  Speaking on behalf of bridge users everywhere though, I can attest to its genius in that it's seamless and simple to use. Although the software is basically stripped down versions of the apps used on the Blackberry, the fact that you can leave your phone in the kitchen while you hold your office on your lap is a treat.  You can also use it to bridge to your Blackberry web browser (more on this in a bit).  I do have some gripes about some of the functionality of the bridging apps which are missing key features like spell check or some expected intuitiveness.  Overall though, they work very well for what they do.Communication - Another critical issue with reviewers has been that this tablet is only WiFi.  Again, since I have a Blackberry, I can tether to the internet through the phone so I have complete internet access when I'm out of Wifi range.  No biggie for me.  Plus I don't need an extra data plan to use it.  Bluetooth A2DP coming in OS 2.0.  WiFi good and strong without any dropouts.Battery Life - Don't really know.  I'd say with heavy use, maybe 5 hours.  Light use more like 10?  Either way, seems on par with everything else that's out there.Typing - Good.  Responsive and easy to do, just need that spell checky/auto correct thingy and we'll be good to go. OS 2.0Internet experience - Without a doubt, the best.  The experience is the same as if you were sitting at your PC.  Flash is flashy, HTML5 is HTML5'y. In short it's what mobile (not really mobile anymore) surfing should be like.  In fact, it's so good that many apps for missing loaders that people are complaining about become unnecessary since they can just be accessed through direct web experience.  Not true of all, but many.Things I'd like to see and, my understanding is most will be addressed in OS 2.0 (due out in February last I heard):- Software improvements to some of the bridge apps to make them a little more intuitive.- A2DP Bluetooth- Android compatibility should open the door up for most apps- Many companies are still loathe to develop apps for the Playbook.  Netflix, Pandora, and Goole Maps come to mind.  However, they can all be made to work by direct net access or, in the case of Netflix, by streaming to a PC and then your Playbook but the Android issue should address this.- A little more customization of categories, naming icons, avatars, etc.  I understand that you'll be able to add quick links to contacts and such in OS 2.0 for instance.In conclusion, I really think RIM has a winner.  It's too bad that the tablet has been panned so badly by critics which is partly due to RIMs poor marketing strategy, no native e-mail, early release of a product that likely wasn't quite ready yet and some good ol' fashioned RIM bashing, but I pay less attention to them and rely more on user input instead.  Most of the user reviews you read are very positive about this system and for good reason which is what attracted me to it.  I can't compare it to other tablets such as the Galaxy or the IPad since I haven't owned either.  I've dabbled on the IPad a bit and it seems every bit as rock solid and well thought out. Given the two however the price point speaks loudly.  $600 vs. $250?  Mmmm, I'm pretty happy with my choice.I ranked this tablet as a 4 star.  I have no doubt that when OS 2.0 comes out in February that most of my wants list will be addressed.

I like and respect the ipad but strongly dislike the lack of compatibility (hdmi, usb) and multitasking (open new tabs easily, have multiple programs running).  Apple makes great products, but as an \"intermediate tech guy\" i want more!!!  So looked elsewhere....asus, acer, blackberry because of compatibility.Pros:Size - personally i love the 7\", smart phone too small, 10\" a lil much.  Can put in my jeans back pocket, not a perfect fit, but keyword is fit.Multitasking - awesome. (you can read that as \"awesome period\"). Really is great.  All windows/applications run in the background (option to turn off if desired i.e. window/app will still be up but not running).  Swipe and go to the next.Compatibility - acts essentially as an external hard drive.  Micro-usb to usb in computer (cord included), click and drag files. Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint on playbook preinstalled!!  Adobe for pdfs!!  I put all my old notes from college on it to try, perfect, you can open all those file types and edit them (and can have each open in their own windows too!!).

I'm sure part of my surprise was due to lowered expectations from reading negative reviews, but the PlayBook is a top notch device (or has potential to be).I mention \"potential,\" because the hardware and interface design is outstanding, but, as many have complained, a lack of native email support and limited applications makes this incomplete.  Hopefully, the OS v2 will release as planned and the promised features will be there.  If it does, I think the PlayBook will be hard to beat.The most impressive feature is the the menu/navigation system.  It is unique and very practical.  To elaborate, the design allows you to view/utilize 100% of the screen until you invoke more options by swiping from below or above the screen.Negatives (all app related): no Netflix player; no LogMeIn, no native email and no Droid Market (until next OS release in Feb)Positives:  hardware; menu/navigation, sound, HD, no iTune-like bloat-ware to manage media (e.g. music, video, pictures)Now that I've experienced the goods, I wish I had paid $50 more for the 32GB version.To be fair, my positive impression is significantly weighed by the promises of the release of OS 2.UPDATE 2012.1.2:PlayBook passes droptest...

I also have a Blackberry (BB) phone so bridging the two was an added benefit for this tablet, but it wasn't essential to my purchasing decision.  I've never owned an iPad or Touchpad so I don't know what I'm missing out on in terms of apps, but to me, there are sufficient apps from BB for what I need.  Navigating on this tablet is a breeze as is multi-tasking between different apps. I can have a web browser open and next to it my camera and next to that a game.  It's actually very cool to minimize an app and still see it working while in a small pane. The product looks very well made and durable and battery life is adequate.  Again I don't have it on hours on end so I'm not sure how many hours you'll get from a full charge.  The one disappointment I have is that there is no flash for the camera.

The best tablet? For me it is. I love the QNX Operating System as well as the size and build of the Playbook. This is such a well made device and it has so many useful features.

For anyone wondering, the apps are getting better and coming out more frequently. The new OS, 2.0, is due soon along with native email and calendar etc. The Android player is due soon, which is nice but I believe there will be more than enough native apps to make the Playbook worthwhile to more people. For me this is the best tablet, and I am a big Apple fan. Me and my wife own an iPod touch. I had the first iPhone and I own a iMac which is a great machine. There is a lot said here in the reviews about the Playbook, but if your on the fence consider getting one now. The tablet is selling well even today. There are more and more companies who make apps for Android / Apple who are making their apps for Playbook. No, Rovio hasn't made Angry Birds yet, but Electronic Arts has already made 3 popular titles available. The new OS update will give the tablet many features people have wanted since it's release and the price is coming down.

Give it a chance!!", "Author": "Kyi", "ReviewID": "RF863KBVO7JR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So about a year ago, I bought myself a netbook. I already own a desktop PC, and Android phone, but I wanted the netbook so I could browse the web on the go and didn't like doing it on my phone because the screen was too small. I've been eyeing the iPads for a while as well, but the price point was just a bit too high for me, seeing as you can buy a decent netbook for cheaper. I was attracted to the touch screen and all the cool little apps you can download, but when it really comes down to it, I just wanted a good portable browser that I could use comfortably for an extended period of time, which I could not do on my phone.Well, after a while of lugging the netbook around, I decided it wasn't so portable after all and more of a pain than I thought it would be to carry it around. Still, I didn't really 'need' a tablet and still didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new device, so I just stuck with it. Then a few months ago, I found out about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet, and realized they were both affordable enough to consider buying one. I also realized I didn't like the 10 inch tablets because they seemed too large and don't have that feeling of portability that I wanted, especially since I already have a 12 inch netbook that already feels cumbersome. I was still unsure though... I didn't know anything about the tablet market and wasn't even sure what else I'd use it for other than browsing the web and random stuff I could do on my phone. I still had my desktop PC after all.I waited a while for the reviews for both the Fire and Nook to come out, read a bunch of them, including comparisons and etc, and decided I would wait a little longer to get one since I wasn't in urgent need of one. A few weeks later, I had some extra cash lying around and decided I was going to bite the bullet and finally order a tablet. I read some more reviews, and based off of those, I realized the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet were just too locked down for me and just seemed like a hub for spending more money on their stores. Some of the negative reviews said the browsers were sluggish or kind of jumpy sometime, and that made me more uncertain. I decided to look into the other 7 inch tablets and see what the difference was between all of them, and see why those tablets cost more. Just for research's sake.Thats when I came across the Blackberry Playbook. I saw that the price had recently been dropped, and even though I missed the fire sale, the $300 price point is still doable (I actually have the 64GB version). Especially for the impressive hardware it comes with. I also considered the Samsung Galaxy 7 tab as well as the Acer Iconia, but both of those are more expensive and doesn't really come with anything that would justify spending that much more on a tablet. And of course, I went into my review reading frenzy, and despite the few negative things that people dislike about the Playbook, it didn't really bother me  much and I decided to give this product a chance and boy am I glad I did!Here's what made this purchase worth it for me and why I am very satisfied with it.-Fast full flash browser. A slow, jerky browser would certainly get on my nerves, everytime I use it. This is important. A lot of other tablets have sub-par browsers and the Playbook browser is surprisingly fast.-Smooth seamless UI. The QNX OS. Like another review stated, I do not want to feel like I am using a large version of my phone, nor do I need another 'compact netbook' device. I want a product that feels unique and different. This is a versatile and powerful electronic toy in a sense. It does everything that I want, and does it well. I don't really care that it isn't Android, especially since it seems to work just as well, if not better.-Beautiful screen. Everyone can agree on that.-Very high quality speakers and placed in a practical location on the device (on the front sides). I really dislike when the speakers are on the back or can easily be muffled, or if they sound cheap and crackly. The volume level is impressive too.-5MP rear and 3MP front facing camera. Most of the other tablets in this price range do not include a camera. I don't think I'll use it that much, but this was definitely a perk as I still want to have it just in case I do decide to start using it. And who doesn't like taking self photos??-You can tether your phone and get GPS as well.And for those who are worried about the lack of apps in the store... I will admit, the store does not have hundred thousands of apps like the other stores, but I do not really feel that limited. There are still plenty of apps, and a lot of free ones as well. And for those who don't know, a new OS release is coming out soon for the Playbook that should fix all those problems that the haters have been complaining about. And honestly anyone who complains about the tiny power button... it's tiny for a reason. It's hard to hit for a reason. Do you want to accidently turn your tablet off in the middle of using it? After you turn it on, you don't even need to turn it off really! You put it in standby mode and all it takes to turn it back on is a simple swipe from top to bottom of the screen. The standby mode does not drain much battery at all. Seriously... sometimes I feel like people just have to find something to complain about because they are fanboys to the other two A words.TLDR: If you want an impressive piece of hardware at a great price and a fast and unique OS, get the Playbook. And if you're concerned about the apps, wait for the new OS release. And if that's still not good enough for you, go buy yourself a dang Apple or Android tablet and stop hating. Trust me, just because they do a lot more marketing and are more popular, does not make them flawless. If you're a TRUE hipster, you'll get off that bandwagon and give this one a chance.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "My iPad is gathering dust", "Author": "Benjamin Franklin", "ReviewID": "R1U2OLKU8PZ5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had an iPad for a couple of years so I held off getting Blackberry Playbook as I couldn't see the point in having two tablets. When the price of the Playbook dropped just before Christmas I decided to treat myself and boy, am I glad I did.I loved it so much I decided the 16GB version just wasn't big enough for me and so I went back out the other weekend and treat myself to the 64gb model, so now I have two Playbooks.So, what is so good about the Playbook and why do I prefer it to the iPad.1. It is just so much nicer to use. By comparison the iPad is clunky and bland. Once you get used to the various screen swipes (there are quite a few) you can just breeze from open application to open application, bring up the keyboard, close an app, open an another app. It is all so amazingly easy and so much more enjoyable than than constantly having to press the button at the bottom of the iPad screen numerous times just to do the most basic thing such as swapping from one app to another. On the Playbook what takes several button presses to do on the iPad takes ONE swipe. Brilliant!2. I far prefer the size of the Playbook. The iPad was too big and bulky for me to lug around. I can just pop the playbook in my pocket and hit the coffee shop. It is like like reading a paperback rather than a heavy hardback book.3. he installed apps are pretty much everything I need and more. Unlike the iPad the Playbook comes with a superb word processor, spreadsheet, etc. Yes, there aren't a million apps to download, but do you know what. I've not touched my iPad in weeks and I've not missed one single app on it - not one!4. It is so much easier to add content onto the Playbook. Just plug it in with a USB cable and copy the files from your computer straight onto the device. No need to mess around with iTunes. Just drag the files over, put them wherever you like and the Playbook will do the rest. I add about one hundred albums and dozens of movies and it took me minutes. The same thing with iTunes would have involved selecting all sorts of things, syncing, resyncing, installing the latest update, and blah blah. None of that with the Playbook, which means I'm free of the nasty iTunes.5. You can connect the Playbook to your TV with an HDMI cable that costs a few bucks. Unlike the iPad which requires a special $40 lead that works some of the time, but not all of the time (check out the reviews of it on Amazon and you will see what I mean).6. The screen display is amazing. Just put it next to an iPad 2 and you can see instantly how much better it is. The colors are vibrant, the text is crystal clear, and it is just so darned fast and smooth. Check out the sample HD video that comes with it.That is just six reasons. There are many more.I honestly can't see me ever wanting to go back to the iPad, but I can see me putting the iPad on eBay in the not too distant future.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best tablet I have ever used...Period.", "Author": "G. Dowling", "ReviewID": "RXKQ6N2Q73NSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing much research and having tried all the premiere tablets on the market, I landed on RIM's BlackBerry Playbook. I tried out the iPad 3 and I was not terribly impressed.  It felt very fragile in my hands, like it could break if I squeezed it too hard, the speakers truly suck as they sound tinny, and these are problems are significant given the money Apple charges.  I have a BB smartphone and I have always been impressed at how well-made their products are.  This made the playbook a no-brainer for me...I had no idea just how superior it is...the QNX processor is lightning fast and can easily manage several open windows.  You can edit word documents, spreadsheets, and it has flash player which iPad does NOT.  The screen and video camera is HD.  I opted for the 64gb model, as the price difference between the three sizes is negligible so it's worth it to upgrade to 64gb.  Though, with cloud storage, for most people, 16gb is probably plenty.  The touch keyboard is exceedingly comfortable and the most intuitive I have ever used...it really does learn how you write and anticipates your word choices.  It has a port for a micro hdmi cable so you can enjoy your downloaded content on your hdtv.  I bought this cable (sold separately)for only 4 bucks on amazon.  The PB is comfortable to hold as the build quality is immediately apparent.  It does not feel like it's going to fall apart if you drop it.  The processor is faster than any laptop I have ever used. The web browser is like flipping pages in a book.  If you have BB phone...it open up a flurry of additional features called BlackBerry Bridge.  The bluetooth connection syncs the two devices so you can manage appts, contacts, view, receive and reply to your text messages using your BB smartphone as a transmitter.  Your phone can be used as a remote control when watching a video or listening to music and you can browse the website for your phone's keyboard...it is a really amazing set of features...and best of all you can use your BB phone's data package to use 3/4g connectivity if you do not have access to to wife/hotspot so you do NOT need to sign up for a data service.If it seems I am gushing over this product, it's because it's that good.  So those of you who may think BB products are out, this will remind you as to why BB has such loyal fans.  And finally, it is simply priced...nowhere else will you find a tablet of such superior quality, enormous storage, awesome features, great versatility (ideal for home and work) and just plain fun for the jaw-dropping low price as I purchased it for slightly over 200 bucks (reg 700). Do not waste your money on the iPad...RIM has outdone themselves with this tablet. Outstanding product.Note: just to recommend some accessories to maximize your enjoyment...make certain to get a case of some description...there are many which come with a bluetooth keyboard built in...I opted for the Otterbox Defender as I have 2 year old twins and this case can take a beating and perfectly preserve your tablet. It has a built-in screen protector and a tough outer protective layer.  Its an amazing case which provides a complete solution.  I also recommend a micro hdmi to reg. Hdmi cable and extra charger.

After trying all contenders, the Blackberry Playbook 32G won by a nose and this is why.The case is sturdy metal, feels substantial, and does not flex.

I like the intuitive fingerswipe sideways to close an app, as well as open program page pulldown from screen top.The system upgraded at first start, took only a few minutes, and now more apps than I will ever need are available. FB, the browser itself, and my email client (gmail) work perfectly, and tethers with bluetooth to most cellphones, mine is an older samsung 3G.Wi-fi is strong, connecting, and maintaining a connection at home or on the go without a hitch. The sound is very loud and clear, with nice response- great for gaming, music, movies, whatever, frankly puts apple and nexus 7 to shame, and there are 2 speakers, not 1 BTW.I have the rapid charging stand which is twice as fast(a charge lasts 10+hours btw, days on standby), and provides a nice pedestal to perch while not in use. I did not have any issues as some mentioned with the standard plug in charger, it was tight and secure, but I could see where the connector could break if bent or forced at the insertion point. I purchased the playbook because of past experience with the brand, the perceived quality, nice price, software updates, processor speed, and just a general balance of design and function. Many will underestimate blackberry, and I think apple already has. Schools and businesses are snapping up the playbook for a reason, these are sturdy and secure. I realize the market has many choices, the hd nook, the kindle fire, and the nexus 7 I feel were close in usability, and may suit those who will spend more time in the B&N;, Amazon (with ads), and Google worlds. The nook hd felt sleek and light but flimsy, the nexus has only one weak sounding speaker, and the kindle hd was slow and heavy. At present PB has no netflix, skype or kindle apps, but it will video chat with other playbooks, and has a kobo app. There is no app for gps function that really functions, and no sim card slot to allow direct access to a data plan. BB will soon offer new models that will. What the playbook does, it does well in my view. With the next software update, it will be even better.

I visited the Blackberry site. I found an instruction manual online and I read it. I made  judgments on which reviews are constructive, and which are just plainly absurd. I settled on the Playbook. So, I wasn't disappointed when I got my Playbook in June this year.I took it on my trip in July to the Canadian Rockies. I was pleased that I could check both my personal e-mail on Yahoo and my work e-mail on Outlook. I took pictures using the Playbook (I had the camera on and put in in the pocket of the car door) when I couldn't fire up my Sony Hx9v fast enough to snap pictures of mountain goats, sheep and elks. (Almost took a picture of a black bear crossing the road. Kathy: Look, a bear. Bear: Oh #$%^, humans).I have since been able to side-load some android apps, which now has become a bonus. I am now able to read magazine from our public libraries. All in all I am happy.A side note: Blackberry people, you need to market your products better!Updated on August 25, 2012OK, so I didn't expect to do heavy-duty work on the PB. I did use the Print to Go feature, as well as sending myself word, pdf and PPT docs by email. I am able to work to the fullest extent that PB is capable of. Then, I do back to work and immediate hit the road running. That makes my Mondays are more prepared and pleasant.My Sony Hx9v is my dedicated camera, but I also take \"duplicate\" pics and videos on my playbook for sharing them with my co-workers. It's more handy and discrete than putting them on my work computer, and the Sony scree is too small anyways.I also take the PB to off site meetings (we have WiFi at all our sites).

Perfect size to carry in my purse, I use it constantly at home or on the go.Fantastic value for the $200 price, quality build, blazing fast.

Effortless, elegant.I bought an iPad2 a few months prior, at five times the price, hate the clunky slow interface and never use it anymore, too big and heavy to carry around.  I work in a large IT department, many of my colleagues have made the change from iPad to PB in the past few months, it's just a better device for business or pleasure.My favourite application is library one, download free books from any public library. More apps available every day.Bought three PB's as gifts for family members, wonderful gifts for great value. Our home PC is rarely used anymore.A writer friend bought one with accessory keyboard , she travels a lot and loves keeping a journal on the road.  Last trip she forgot her camera but was thrilled with the PB camera and ability to email quality photos from the road.

I almost pulled the trigger on the HP Slate, as it was a workhorse machine I desperately needed to meet all my working needs (not playing needs).  Unfortunately, it was not a touch-friendly machine.  Several years later, here I am with a Blackberry Playbook.This tablet will serve all of  your WORKING needs and some of your playing needs.  It will also address ALL of your media needs.  That's the bottom line.Multitasking is true and familiar for Windows people.  Navigation is natural and makes sense. You can side load apps.  You can access items on your laptop, home, or office PC on the tablet via the Internet (ORB).  PPT presentation (presentation mode) is spectacular.  You can connect to VGA projectors (additional accessories necessary).  It does everything for a person who needs to get things done.There's some talk about the power button being too small.  I disagree.  It's actually well placed and sized to avoid accidental on/off.I purchased the 16GB, as I figured I wouldn't use it that often.  It is now my go-to computer and I have found myself loading more and more items I need on the machine.  I wish I had purchased the large drive. However, given the FTP program and the ability to access files on other computers, this probably won't be an issue.Cons:-No Skype (there is an available program, but not seamless)-APP marketplace still slow going - APPS are a bit pricey.I am incredibly impressed with this machine.

I wanted a device more portable then my iPad that would provide both entertainment and functionality.  After watching/reading several reviews on the Blackberry Playbook, I was super stoked to receive mine!Unfortunately, that enthusiasm didn't last very long.  I quickly discovered how, um, blah the device was.  RIM did an amazing job with the QNX operating system; it's super faster, beautiful, and an absolute pleasure to use.  With that being said, the lack of app. support in the Blackberry community has left this device struggling to find its place among smart phones and the iPad.Without apps., you basically have a device with a camera that can play movies.  Sure, there's the internet and such.  But it's a WiFi only device (unless you have a Blackberry smartphone to bridge).  If you find yourself out of range of a hotspot, there's nothing left to do except watch movies/listen to music.I suppose you could read a book.  But wait!  There's no Kindle app.  Instead, you have a Kodo application in which you're expected to repurchase your library.Sigh.  I'm really disappointed with this device.  It has such great potential if the community would get behind it and support it.  To be honest, I don't see that happening.  With Apple's IOS dominating the majority of the tablet world and Google's Android sucking up what's left over, I don't see much room for a new \"competitor\".So to break it down, here's my Pros & Cons list.Pros:-Beautiful Design-Portable-Great camera (can record in 1080HD)-Beautiful and fast operating systemCons:-Lack of app. selection-No Netflix app. and the Playbook's browser isn't supported by their online streaming service-No Skype-No Zinio-No \"good\" eBook reader-No native email or calendar app. on the device (they include web shortcuts to Gmail, Hotmail, etc.)As you can see, the majority of the cons are due to a lack of app. support from developers.  Until there's more support for this device, you're stuck with a 7\" internet browsing/movie watching device.  And if that's what you want, just get an iPad; bigger screen, more enjoyable experience.  And as I said earlier, if you're out of range of a WiFi hotspot, you're pretty much SOL.Overall, I rate the device's design, operating system, and smoothness a 5/5.

Simply because it doesn't read flash, it's too big, and I think the price is a little ridiculous to pay for something that's a larger scale of what I already have and doesn't do everything I want it to do. However, I still wanted something aesthetically appealing, sleek, sturdy, and about $200. I looked at the kindle fire but it lacks a camera and I looked at the nexus 7 but at $200 you get 8g instead of 16g. I had seen the PB at Best Buy and a few minutes playing with it I wanted it .. After further research and reading the reviews (good/bad) I bought it for these reasons: The screen quality is awesome and makes the screen look bigger than 7inches, the fluidity of the platform is so sleek, and I really like the swipe up/swipe down feature (instead of the home button on an iPad). It has a rubberized back for a no slip grip and is light. Sound is great n doesn't sound cheap. I read the battery life was long and it definitely is!  After the first charge I didn't have to recharge for 3 days .. I suppose if you use it all day long it'll last about 9hrs.Apps:If you're an app maniac don't buy it! The PB does not play Netflix which is a bummer but I honestly watch Netflix only on a TV, it doesn't have instagram but I'm not trying to whip out a tablet to take a picture, that's what my iPhone is for, and as far as games go, everytime I've DL one on my iPhone it becomes a waste of space and I usually delete them after a few days . As a college student, Docs to go and adobe reader (comes standard) is great,  it will definitely come in handy for lecture when I have to write or retrieve PDF and word documents. It also comes with the essential FB, twitter, and YouTube apps. From what I have been reading on the net there are ways to sideload android apps,haven't tried .. Not sure if I will.Internet and wifi:The wifi connection is strong and picks up signals my laptop can't..Im sure the Bluetooth connection is just as strong just haven't tried it. The Internet browsing is crisp, clear, and fast! I REALLY needed a tablet that read flash I shop a lot online and a lot of sites use it and my online class requires it for viewing homework and since the PB reads flash it's perfect and runs smoothly with no freezing. Other reviewers say its like browsing on a desktop and they're right!Accessories:Not very many and kinda hard to find. I'm really big on housing for my devices but I ended up finding this Swedish company, Dicota , that makes covers for playbook and has a nice quality.Overall, extremely satisfied with my BBPB!

RIM's tablet packs the power of a mini-laptop in a pocket-sized form.Pros:- It has crystal-clear display- Very resistant and stoutly built- Fast, with more than enough power to run heavy applications and games.- Feature-rich with HD rear facing camera, a chatting front-faced camera, GPS, Wi-fi, HDMI and Bluetooth.- GPS apps don't work while connected only to BlackBerry Bridge but they work while tethered to a BlackBerry phone or connected to a wi-fi mobile AP on Android (see below) The included app Bing Maps does a good job similar to google maps, and can even give me driving directions (in my country, Google Maps doesn't do that)When partnered with a BlackBerry phone (I have one) the result is more than the sum of its parts. The tablet can function as a big screen for the phone, and the phone works as a wireless modem for the tablet (over Bluetooth)If you have an android phone v2.2 or above (I have one too) the phone can share its  internet connection with the Playbook via Mobile Wi-fi AP. Also, I can transfer files between the phone and the tablet with an android free application installed on the phone called AirDroid.Cons:- A little bit on the heavy side, but still lighter than any 10 inch tablet.- Battery life isn't spectacular, when I used it through the day, I must charge it overnight, every night.- A certain lack of applications, but this is an item that gets more value as more people buy it.

It may not be able to match up to the iPad in some ways, but in the most important aspects for a solid tablet, this thing is fantastic! Just as good or even better than the iPad in some ways.Price: I'm not sure why they sell this for so cheap. Hands down. Great deal.Screen: full 1080p HD. Connect directly to your HD tv! convenient!iTunes Music: has a great app called iTunes sync to buy for $4. will probably sync all or most of your music! some mightnot sync because of protection on the music file. Pretty good music app to find your playlists, artists, etc.Camera: full HD pics and videos. haven't used it much, but works good as far as I know!Messaging: email is great! notification light is goodDocs to Go: Word and Excel files! you can view powerPoint. Adobe PDF reader too!Print to Go: Connect wirelessly to your laptop through the internet. Put a Word, Excel, or PDF file directly onto your tablet to view. This is very nice to be able to put files onto your playbook.Battery: pretty good! Not great. But again mine is used. it's good enough for me! I charge it every couple days or so. Depends on how much you use it (kinda obvious).Wifi works great!! it will remember multiple networks and connect automatically when you're there.eBooks: has Kobo. I'm not big on eBooks. So I don't really care that much. Does NOT support Kindle. I don't think Kobo has nearly as much as Kindle.Pretty good facebook app. You can also just connect to FB using the regular fb website.INTERNET: wow!! this is one of the best things about this. it's fast, smooth, great screen. You don't need tons of apps for the internet when you can connect directly! flast supported, JavaScript. Complete web pages, pinch to zoom. VERY NICE. I'm going to college and this thing is small and good to carry around campus.Not perfect but it's very good. Doesn't have tons of great apps like itunes or netflix.

There are some minor annoyances like the random browser crash (rarely with OS 2.0.1.358) or 3rd party app crashes. The most problematic issue I have came across was when I would open an android app through the app player which would make the entire OS run less efficient. I hardly use the anrdoid app player, so I'm not too annoyed. The main selling point for me was the small form factor and the drastic price drop which made this tab irresistible.

You can shut down or hibernate the playbook via a control on the screen and awaken it from hibernation with a swipe gesture from the bezel onto the screen. The gesture controls in general are quite intuitive to learn and really make navigation efficient and easy.The Cons:I am not overly impressed with the battery life, compared to my Ipad it's actually quite poor.No native e-mail and calendar support is absurd, this will hopefully be a non-issue once OS 2.0 is released later this month.App store really is lacking in quality apps, I am hoping that RIMS push to have android developers port their apps to the PB plays off.A lot is riding on the release of OS 2.0 this month, I think if RIM executes it properly the Playbook will see some life, it really is a great device.

It does that straight from the website because it supports flash.Answer emails and prepare work related stuff.Plug in the mini HDMI and watch the movie on my TV.I do not care about many apps but the apps I do wish they had was Netflix and Skype but it is not a deal breaker for me because I can use them on my phone, other tablets, PC, etc.  Also I know that you can port android apps and I have already done it for a few of them but I think it is just one step and if you are not technically savvy it can put people off.Bottom line, I think it is a good tablet, I am hoping that it will only get better with the release of the new OS but it is good already, but if you do the cost analysis of acquiring one vs. any other electronic out there I think the playbook will come up on top just for the price point of it alone.

I also have a generic 7\" android tablet for comparison.  The BBPB is really nice.  The interface, the response, the touch and feel, are superior to the android tablets.  It makes deleting apps and updating apps so much easier.  The Ice Cream Sandwich on the android tablets is ok, not sure what the big deal is about, it's still a bit cumbersome to get around.  The BBPB is much smoother and nimble, especially when it comes to web browsing.  I tried 3 different browsers on the android tablets and they crash quite often whereas the BBPB gives me much more confidence in its stability.  I thought after the past few years with the smart phones and tablets that Android tablets would be stable, but with so many different hardware variations, it's still a bit of a Wild Wild West - It's akin to Windows XP versus Windows 7 on a PC.  The only drawback to the BBPB is the apps that are available.  It's still a bit thin and I do not think BB will introduce a Android run-time environment so that you can run android apps on your Playbook (even though they said they would oh so long ago).  On a positive note, you can side-load 1/3 of the android apps on your BBPB.  You can look that up.  Finally, the BBPB just feels like a serious piece of hardware.  Plus, you can get what was recently a $400 tablet for about $150 now.  Not too shabby.  Hope this helps.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome tablet!! No comparison!", "Author": "A.

Also the Ipad is relatively large and heavy compared to a 7\" tablet and finally the Ipad couldn't configure my Microsoft exchange based email account.I have a blackberry phone and heard about the playbook's feature that enables users to use the phone's internet accesss on the playbook.  The other deciding factors was the very reasonable price (a small fraction of the cost of the Ipad) and the lighter/smaller size of the playbook vs the Ipad.  I also had confidence in the playbook's email capabilities premised upon the blackberry telephone's ability to immediately and flawlessly configure and intergrate my email accounts including the Microsoft Exchange based account.I purchased the 16GB version of the Playbook.  Upon powering up (and connecting to WIFI), the playbook immediately updated the OS to the latest version (took about 20 minutes for download and installation) automatically. The screen is very bright and sharp comparable (but not quite there) to the Ipad.  The touch screen is also excellent and (almost) as good as the Ipad.  There is no button to return the home screen (rendering the Ipad more convenient in this context).The apps available for the Playbook pale in comparison to the Ipad.  However two particular apps; docs to go (included in the OS) and Blackberry Bridge (free download) make the Playbook more appealing to me than the Ipad.  Blackberry Bridge seamlessly lets your blackberry telephone provide internet access to the Playbook (after an easy bluetooth connection is established).  It's really amazing.  There is no longer any \"tethering\" app needed (which apparently was necessary in the old OS). The internet for some unexplained reason is much faster on the playbook than on the phone (perhaps because of processing power involved in screen redraws but I am not really sure why). Docs to go is a Microsoft Office type program similar (to the extent a 7\" tablet can be) and compatible with Microsoft Word.  The Ipad does not have any such program built in and available apps (for purchase; ie pages) are not as good.Battry life is great, a whole day even with wifi on.  As expected, all my email accounts are intergrated and accessible on the playbook (although the phone's setup seemed a little easier) including the Microsoft Exchange based account that the Ipad could not configure to work. Email contacts, calenders, BBM contacts etc are all easily imported from the phone.There is one big drawback (for me anyway) and the reason I only gave 4 stars in this review; the icompatibility of Skype.  There is an excellent webcam on the playbook but for some reason there is no Skype app.  The only way to access the video communciation capabilities is by communicating with another playbook.  The Ipad (in contrast) works really, really well with skype.  Someone would make a lot of money if they developed a reasonably priced app that enabled skype to work on the playbook based upon the clamor on the internet for such an app.  If Skype becomes compatible with the Playbook, the Blackberry Playbook would be a really great tablet at this price point.There is no (Micro)SD slot to expand the internal memory.  The cynic in me believes that is because RIM would like to sell the 32GB version for more money than the 16GB version (there would not be much demand for the 32GB version if there was expandable storage capabilities).  Of course the Ipad does not have any such capabilities either (presumambly for the same reason).MP3 playback works great on the playbook.  It is much easier to copy MP3s onto the playbook than the ipad (no itunes necessary).  A free app makes creating playlists as simple as creating folders on the Playbook (much better than the Ipad or even the ipod).  Videos are also much easier to copy onto the playbook (again no itunes necessary).  However, the file formats seem to be more limited on the playbook; I have been unable to find an app to play .avi files so far.Before purchasing the Blackberry Tablet, I tried (and immediately returned) one of the generic $100 android 7\" tablets.  There is really no comparison between the playbook and the cheap android tablets.  The touch screen on these 7\" android tablets is terrible, WIFI routinely cuts off, the screen is not very bright and the battery only lasts a few hours.  The only \"advantages\" of the cheap 7\" tablets is compatibility with skype (which works horribly) and many more apps which is not really and avantage since the tablet itself is not usable.In summary, this is an excellent tablet considering the price.  It becomes almost essential if you also have a blackberry telephone.  The lack of Skype compatibility may be a deal breaker for some though.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING DEVICE!!!", "Author": "BIGxALx420", "ReviewID": "R1CVX21AKW1MXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this refurb from BestBuy for $150 and I could not be happier.I have downloaded several torrent files and loaded them as a bar file to my playbook.I watch MLB.TV using the simple browser set to desktop IE mode...I am SOOO happy i bought this and didnt waste my money on a sub par device.I love watching movies on my tv via the hdmi port.Who needs apps when you can do everything without them?

Android Market, 1Mobile Market or other markets (are just that) other markets and will not currently work with this line : Blackberry Playbook. In using this tablet there are many strengths and few bummers. The strengths are its well made parts, great screen resolution, superb sound that is front facing you with excellent sound quality. The bummer is the tiny power button, no HDMI built in, however it does accept most mini connectors to your HDMI TV, AND ! when connected to your HDTV performs well.  The APPS available through Blackberry are good, but you have to search through each category and try them out. The overall experience as well as the many free app's, utilities, TV programs (English and French) are good. Sound is far more superb than most tablets, image quality far superior. The power button is small and hard to access, there is the s-l-o-w-e-s-t start up ever for a tablet, and takes what seems to be a seriously delayed start up.  Some nice things are that when online, making purchases, you can instantly take a picture of anything you are experiencing simply by pressing the top arrow keys together at the same time located next to the power button.. this sends any image then to your pictures.The other odd thing is that you cannot upgrade the tablet with a micro SD card, but 16MB of built in flash is good. Another annoyance is to charge the tablet all connections are on the bottom of the tablet (rather than the sides) which can lead to the tablet wanting to fall from surfaces.  The Pro's certainly outweigh the Con's for this nice tablet that is like no other.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "BlavkBerry PlayBook 64 GB", "Author": "1970 Mach 1", "ReviewID": "R2Q79S4WP0R1ZV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazon is sell the same model for $35 more than NewE??.com.I was skepticle about buying the PlayBook, because the mainstream seems to iPAD or Androids, and a lot of people complaint about the lack of applications.The price kept me looking at it, and I just could not find a better price tablet with 64 GB (I paid $299, not tax, no shipping).  I bought the PlaayBook before the OS 2 was released.  After about two weeks, I decided that most negative comments I found were on the mark.  It would definitely take some get used to.  One of the more annoying problem was the Browser closed without any warning.Then the OS 2 release, I upgraded the PlayBook.  Things changes dramatically, it is like I had two totally different machines.  The browser now is much stable (still had 1 crash after OS2).  All the apps are smooth (except one).  The Documents to GO can read and edit my Excel files withour any issues.  Apps may still lacking, but I bought the tablet to do a few things: 1. Surf the Net; 2. Read my stories in PDF (they were Word files); 3. Photo show; 4.  Play MP3s; 5. Play videos; 6. as an appointment book (OS 2 comes with an excellent calendar app); 7. As an address book; 8. Play some games.The tablet was meant to be my travel item (I am tired of bringing my 7 lb Dell).Now, the bad - As I said the Documents to Go is a great app., but my PlayBook could not start the presentation part (like PowerPoint), everytime I tried, it gave me an \"Internal Error Code\".  I contacted BlackBerry, and they acknowledged receiving my support request, it is now 4 days later, I still only get 2 of the 3 functions of Documents to Go.If I can ignore this issue, i could easily give the PlayBook a 4.5 stars, simply because the Tablet is well built, and with OS2, it can compete with everything on the market.

We just got it for Christmas and have only had it for 2 days.  I was looking at the fire, and happened to come across this by accident.  At $189.00, we had to try it.  My husband has a work Blackberry with a full data plan, so we were excited to get the added ability to bridge at no extra cost.  The bridge was easy to use and install.  The other thing I wanted was to be able to use Amazon Prime to stream free videos for the kids.  Most reviews were mixed on this, but we had no problem!  There are not many apps, but we purchased this as a family gift, and there are plenty of free and cheap apps to keep the family happy (ages, 7, 4, 3).  We have an ipad, so I was a little worried that it wouldn't compare, but it is fantastic.  I love the smaller size of the Playbook and even though it is very different to maneuver, all three kids were able to figure it out. This was a great choice and a cheap alternative to the ipad.  I can't wait to try all of the functions and to see what the Blackberry is able to do.  I also heard that in a few months Blackberry is going to offer Android apps.  I'm not holding my breath, because I heard that the release date has been pushed back a few times, but this would be an added bonus!", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for Blackberry smartphone owners", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R2FK9OKMUV3S8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this product so much, I decided to write my first ever product review.  I bought my Playbook on sale for $199 and have had it for about a week.  So far, it has done everything I want a tablet to do (once I figure out how to do each task). I want my tablet to be an extention of my smartphone and to take the place of my laptop in a pinch.  I travel a lot and I drag my laptop along so I can check news, email, etc, on something larger than my Blackberry phone screen. I do have to review/edit MS Office files on occaision, but it's usually minor work. I looked hard at the IPad II and the Asus Transformer and was headed down the road to buy the Asus after reading reviews of both.  But, when Radio Shack put the Playbook on sale for $199, I had to take a closer look at it and ended up buying it. So far, this is just what I was looking for.  Here's my take:Pros:-Connectivity to my Blackberry smartphone. No 3G version needed.  The Playbook connects via Bluetooth to my phone and my computer.  I can check/send email, move files, listen to music, etc, between all three devices.  I can also connect to it through its IP address on the internet and move info.  So whether I'm in the house connected via Wi-Fi or away from the house connected via Bluetooth (to my phone), I'm always connnected.  The devices find the best way to connect and make it happen automatically. Of course, you can always connect via a USB cable.-Price: Though it lists for about $500 along with most other 16 GB tablets, Radio Shack still has it on sale for $199.  For that price, you are in the same range as the various e-readers such as the Kindle Fire (did I mention it has e-reader apps available?).  Side to side, there is no comparison in overall capability/flexibility.  I spent $150 to buy my daughter a Kindle Touch and I'm now considering spending the extra $50 to get so much more in the Playbook.-Performance/usability: This is equally as fast as the IPad and the Asus I tried out and the picture is just as vibrant.  It doesnt' have all of the propriatary software issues that Apple products have when working between Apple and PC based platforms.  It is a 7\" versus a 10\" pad.  I thought I wanted a larger pad, but after using the smaller one, I think I like it better.  I'm mostly surfing the web and doing email and I'm not likely to watch movies on it, so smaller works better because it's just the right size to hold and \"thumb type\" like you would your smartphone.  The larger pads are too big to thumb type and too small to type regularly (thus the Transformer's add on keyboard). I'm not going to type an essay on the thing anyway--just short replies and web addresses.Cons:-Instructions: It doesn't come with any other than how to hook up to Wi-Fi.  You have to get on the web and search for directions.  The setup screens are about as weak as they get.  So, I spent a number of hours off and on over my Christmas vacation sorting out how to make it do all the things mentioned above.-File management: There is no file manager on the tablet.  To manage files (or even see what you have) you have to hook up to your computer and work from there or search for it via the applicable software.  So, if you have a Powerpoint file on your playbook, the only way to find it is by opening the Powerpoint viewer and searching for it. No big deal if you have your computer nearby to open the desktop manager and search, but if you are on the road, you are out of luck--unless you carry your laptop with you on the road which defeats the whole purpose.  Maybe there is a better way, but I haven't found it yet and as mentioned above, it's short on instructions.But, in the end, I like it a lot. I'm about to hit the road again, so we'll see how it holds up.

You can hardly tell the difference between a desktop browsing experience and the Playbook. All the streaming videos, games and social networking that I've come to see in a desktop is packed in this ultra portable tablet. Support for Adobe Flash 10.2 and HTML5 means you get all what the internet has to offer. I haven't seen this actually in any other tablet yet. Tablets will either have HTML5 or the Adobe Flash Player; not both. The flash performance is probably the best I've seen on a tablet. It can run a solid handful of apps simultaneously without freezing, slowing performance or going \"catatonic\". In other words, you get true multitasking and incredible reliability you can count on. The build quality seems to be very high, and the video hardware is great, as evidenced by the resolution of the sample video clip that is provided in it. It has a stunning multimedia with rich stereo sound and a crystal clear, high resolution display optimized for HD content. I enjoy movies, music, home videos and even the web in high definition on my HDTV with a standard HDMI connection. The camera doesn't have flash, but it takes phenomenal pictures and videos in 1080p. It also has Face-to-face video chat. With the built-in video chat, you can call another BlackBerry PlayBook with a simple tap; view your caller on the high resolution 7\" display, or output to an HDTV with HDMI to share the conversation with a group. You can even use other apps while you're on a call. Even though the Playbook has a limited BlackBerry App World, this is only temporary. Soon many of our favorite apps for BlackBerry smartphones and Android will soon be available for the Playbook. Even though they say the contrary, the Playbook has tons of capability once you unlock its full potential. The BlackBerry PlayBook offers uncompromised performance in an ultra portable design. I personally am very happy to have it and I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good ultra portable and reliable tablet.

Here's why I returned the A100 for the BP. . .Okay, so I am not a serious tech person and not in the habit of writing reviews. This is my first tablet.After doing my due diligence, I decided on purchasing the Acer Iconia A100, which I was very excited to obtain, based on the many positive reviews here and elsewhere. It seemed to me the A100 was a much better bang for one's buck than the Nook Tablet or Kindle Fire. I purchased my A100 on Dec 16th for around $260 at Best Buy.My A100 performed well at first. I was not pleased though with the touch screen and found it terribly inconvenient to type on, often needing to retype letters and phrases numerous times.After two days of use, mainly web browsing, watching videos, and the Kindle Reader app, the A100 became less responsive and developed a considerable lag, until finally it started freezing/locking up and requiring me to do a hard reset, which I had to do at least 6 times in the couple of days I had it.So, I decided to return and found that the Blackberry Playbook (BP) was on sale at Best Buy for $199, some $60 cheaper than what I paid for the A100. Not to mention, the BP is 16G while the A100 is only 8G.Hands down the BP outperforms the A100 in every way. It is LIGHTNING FAST, with multiple applications running all at once, incredibly smoothly. The screen on the BP is 1080p versus the Acer's 720p. I can not get over the stunning crisp bright HD images on the BP screen. Also, the screen on the BP can be viewed askance and at an angle, whereas the A100 can not.The touchscreen keyboard is a PLEASURE to use. It is well sized and perfectly responsive. No retyping, ever.The current reader on the BP is the Kobo Reading App, which does the job for me, but admittedly is not nearly as good as the Kindle App on the A100. Also, I should mention there is no Netflix App for the BP, yet.Oh, and the BP battery lasts a MUCH longer time than the A100. The BP battery can also be recharged via a USB to your computer.For $60 less than the A100, the Blackberry Playbook OUTPERFORMS the A100 in EVERY WAY. The current price of $199 at Best Buy is a STEAL. This is a tablet that draws serious comparison (watch the video reviews online) to the IPAD2. All for $199!For someone who was in the market for his first tablet, to use mainly for web browsing, some work with documents/email, an Ereader (a Kindle App should be coming soon), and for video and music (Rhapsody!)

The seller was top notch; received it in less than a week with free amazon shipping.  What a tremendous bargain to own a 64 Gig Blackberry Playbook at 250 in change.  The playbook is fantasic; the QNX OS is really great and easy to use.  I have android tablets but playbook is simply different.  Looks like alot of native apps like you tube and news reader are package web based items; repackaged and streamlined into an app.  I can read news without searching the web, since all the news are paged by topic in a native app.  The display is sharp; the speakers are awesome; overall just a great none android tablet but allow you to run android apps in their new android player (not an app) but invoked when any android applicaiton installed on the playbook is run.

The computer geek I was sitting on the plane with pulled out a Nexus tablet and I asked him how he liked it. He said he wished he had waited a little because he would have bought the playbook which is now selling for under $200. It had better memory, screen, and sound. So I took his advice and bought the playbook. The setting up of my email, contacts and calendar from outlook was easy. I love the documents to go function. Now I can load on some excel spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations and some word documents that I need while traveling. This really made it very usable for more than just a movie viewer. The only disappointments that I have is that gotoassist does not have an app that will work on this so I can connect co-workers computers to solve problems and that there is not an SD card slot.

I also like the UI, the way the app drawer appears below the main screen and the way the apps open in the middle of the screen and then expand to fill the screen. In short, the Playbook has almost become my favorite EXCEPT FOR ONE THING!!!!! That one thing is the disappointing sparcity of useful applications; there just are not many. I'm not comparing the raw number against iOS or Android. A few really good apps are all that are. necessary, and those are sorely lacking. I have not found a good search engine, browser or office suite. I have heard that RIM will begin making Android apps available for the Playbook \"SOON\". RIM seems to have \"SOON\" as its company motto! Everything is GOING to happen SOON; RIM just does not deliver on its promises of \"SOON\".I think it's a lamentable shame.

I have to tell you that I researched a lot prior to buying this tablet, ok the iPad shure is better BUT is a lot bigger, heavier and expensive, I'm not able to type as fast with the iPad as with the PlayBook, awsome virtual keyboard, I dream of having one like that in my Torch 9860 that is not great as the one provided with QNX.About apps, this is a professional tablet for work so I'm very satisfied with the Docs to Go app that is WONDERFUL I do edit a lot of docs on the go and I need a simple and convenient way to do presentations so the mini HDMI port is the key for me for that, just plug the tablet to a big screen and I'm set.

I use the Playbook to watch videos downloaded and streamed too. The videos look better on the playbook than they do on any of my computers or TV's. I also love that it has Micro USB and Micro-HDMI so it easily connects the playbook to TV's computers etc.. I also think that it reacts well when I touch it and doesn't seem too slow or tentative. The browser is also pretty good. It comes with a bookmark page similar to speeddail, so searching through your favorites is very convenient.Cons: Others have stated how the apps are limited in number available to the public. That's a huge understatement. There isn't a real Twitter, Reddit, or even TMZ app. I know you may now all be thinking that's a weird combination of apps that I've brought up and my reply to that is \"Well I like to be in the LOOP.\" Now to bringing me back to a pro, the Bookmark page holds enough dials that it is easy to sort through all your favorite websites. Also browsing those websites that don't have an app for the Playbook are not an inconvenience on most sites..Conclusion: If you are wanting to play with apps or use popular apps or wanna do anything at all other than play the Free Need for Speed game that is a really fun game, you had better not get this tablet.

My wife bought me a 32GB for my birth day and I decided to get 4 more.  One for another personal use so that I and my wife can connect.  The rest are for company use.  Depending on your need, you may find PB has no real use if you are into apps to run through your day.  However, only a handful of currently available paid and free apps, I find it very helpful for my daily need both personal and at work.Here is my short review.Pros:Size, I find it to be just a sweet spot to lug it around.  For any short business trip, I have been successfully leaving my laptop behind.Specs, for its current discounted prices, you can't find anything close to it.  It has 2 HD cameras front and back.  Of course, 5MP front and 8MP back would be nice, but it is good enough.  It has flash and support html5.  Being Amazon prime member, I am really happy being able to stream movie directly with my PB.  The list goes on, but last but not least, its multi-tasking is above average.  Higher memory to 2GB would be super nice, but it has yet frozen or crashed on me.BB Bridge, some may find this less appealing, but I love it and look forward to the OS2 release.  Check the 2012 CES report and you will understand what I am referring to.Cons:Apps, again it is a toss up depending on what you are looking for.  So you know what you are going into.  This is not iPad or Android apps market.  Study and see if it fits ya.SW, it needs an update really bad.  Currently, it lacks native file browser, languages support (South East Asia, for example), spelling checking, etc.  But the new OS should address most of these.I should also note that I do not like the charing setup via micro usb.  I have seen a few displays at a few shops in town with broken micro usb and the thing stuck to the device!  I am sure it was due to the abuse from potential client, but thought that I mention it.  Last but not least, the power button seems to have issue and its depends. Some unit will have a really flush power button making it hard to use.If you are a doubter and know that you do not need hundreds apps to get your job done, give it a whirl.

I don't love it (which would have been a 5 star). In short - the hardware is nice, feels good, seems of high quality. The software is limited and lacks some of the features that I would like to see. I am not an expert user and also non-ideological when it comes to brands (Apple vs. Android vs. RIM). I am a long time user of Blackberry smartphones and really like them. I was thinking about a tablet for a long time and jumped on the Playbook mostly due to the good price and the size.I find the name of the tablet fitting - Playbook. This is exactly what this device is good for. It's a nice extension to my laptop and my smartphone that I will continue to take on my travels. That's why I prefer the smaller size of the Playbook over the bigger iPad. I am sure the iPad is a great device and from all I hear and have experienced myself, it has superior touch and feel and certainly more applications than the Playbook. That's probably my biggest critizism of the Playbook. Apps are limited and I am mostly missing Google Maps and Skype functionality. I like the Blackberry Bridge functionality that allows for accessing emails on the tablet, but I cannot e.g. download attachments. This seems to be a bug connected to the Blackberry Enterprise server software, something I unfortunately have no influence on. So I am really waiting for that Operating System upgrade that RIM is promising and that is announced for Feb 2012.In summary, what I like:+ Size+ Price+ High quality touch and feel+ Speed (e.g. browser speed is great!)+ video/photo qualityWhat I don't like:- Limited apps (no google maps, no skype,...)- waiting for OS upgradeI would recommed the Playbook if you are looking for a handy extra device for mostly... play.

I'm not an Apple fanboy as I happily use both Macs and PCs, and feel like there's a place for both.  I have an iPad 2, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of Apple products and tablets in general.  What I wanted to try in the Playbook was a smaller form factor and apps that helped improve productivity.  Here are my impressions:Pros:- build quality is phenomenal.  RIM must be applauded for the device, which has tight build tolerance, high-quality materials, and a nice feel.- The display is likewise terrific.  Bright, clear, high contrast.- Initial setup was painless, and I was up and running in 10 minutes.- Price!  Compared to the Toshiba Thrive or Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus, it's hundreds of dollars cheaper.- The web browser is a full-fledged browser.  Unlike the iPad, I can browse the full Wall Street Journal website.  Big thumbs up for this.- GPS worked well.- Audio volume and quality is superior to the iPad.Cons:- Lack of apps!  This is the main reason that I returned it.  No Kindle app?  No easy way to read my own eBooks?  Yes, one can use the Kindle reader through Amazon's website, but that's not doable if you're not in a wifi area.  What if you're on an airplane?  No mail app either?  No calendar app? Similarly, no Pandora app.  Yes, you can use the browser...however...- The web browser kept crashing on me.  Over and over and over.  I restarted the tablet, reset the tablet.  Didn't help.  I found it maddening.  Other apps crashed fairly regularly too (like Spotify), but not as much as the browser.- I'm not sure a 7 inch tablet is a good form factor for web surfing.  It's way easier on a 10 inch tablet.  Duh.  But I found it pretty hard to read the screen - got a headache after a few minutes.  This is probably the downside of having the same website views as on a full-sized computer.- Steve Jobs comment about needing sandpaper to narrow your fingers so they tap the screen effectively seems pretty accurate.- I would have really liked an SD card slot (or even micro-SD).All in all, I'm not sure if the Playbook is better or worse than the Kindle Fire (it's not quite fair to compare it to the iPad, which retails for hundreds of dollars more).  The hardware is superior on the Playbook.  But the lack of usable apps hobbles it.  Maybe the supposed February software update will render it great.  But the update isn't set in stone, and RIM has already pushed it back from summer 2011.  So it's a gamble.  The question is, does the tablet work for me in its current state?  For me, no.Last note - I don't have a Blackberry smartphone.  If I did, and was able to use Blackberry bridge to tether my Playbook and get access to my mail and calendar, many of the weaknesses would be rendered moot.

I was able to get this for $249.00.First the pro-Playbook stuff:I was looking for something portable to replace or augment my laptop in a way that would allow me to be more productive, and I liked the idea that the Blackberry Playbook could bridge to my Blackberry smartphone.  This is HUGE.  When I am riding the subway, this allows me to update my calendar, task list and other stuff on the Playbook and automatically have it show up on my smartphone.  At 32 GB, I haven't even begun to hit the limit, and I have several movies, a ton of books, and lots of pictures, plus a moderate amount of music on it (I set my Playbook to sync with my Top 25 most Played list of my IPod, and then added a few other specific artists).  The size is great.  It is a little big to fit in the pocket of a suit coat, but the size is perfect for the inside pocket of an overcoat, or a large external pocket of a coat.  This puts it at about the right size for a small to medium woman's purse, I think.  Basically it is the same size as the Kindle Fire.  The screen is very responsive, the high def video is AMAZING, and the learning curve for tactile navigation is very short.  It picks up Wi-Fi very quickly and easily, and it does the same with bluetooth, plus it remembers the key passes for bluetooth or network devices once you enter them, so there is not a lot to remember when you want to sign onto a familiar protected network.Cons:  It is a little heavier than I anticipated.  It is LIGHTER than an I-Pad for sure, but you should expect this item to weigh about as much as a small jar of pickles.  This might be an issue for some people, but hasn't been for me.  Occasionally the icons you tap, or buttons you tap take a moment or so to respond.  Sometimes the interface with AppWorld is touch-and-go on downloads.  They HAVE NOT YET RELEASED the Kindle Reader for the Playbook (this is as much RIM as it is Amazon), so I am still waiting for the release of the new Pro-Android App OS under OS2, which is supposed to roll out on February 17th, according to RIM's website and latest industry news.  I will believe it when I see it.APPS:  For now, here is a brief list of APPS I have added and recommend:AIR Browser is a Free App that allows you to explore the file structure on the device like Windows Explorer or the Apple equivalent.  I find this useful to find media that I cannot find, or that the program does not detect (like some AZW files I transferred).EPub Book Reader is another Free App that allows you to do your e-reading, including AZW files.  A NOTE OF CAUTION:  DRM-Protected AZW files will be unreadable as of today's date.  Thus you cannot use this to read Kindle purchased books for the time being.FourPlay - Recommended to me as a FourSquare user, this was described on CIO.com as a useful Free App.LaterDude - just allows you to put a sticky note on your screen and fill it with whatever Post-it type notes you might have for yourself.  Free AppGuitar Playbook - holds various guitar tunings and chords for the whole scale - a neat little app for the guitar players  (you can also use this to tune).Investment Week - Free app - pretty self explanatory, and highly rated.Poynt  - Free app to find stuff nearby like movies, people, businesses, restaurants, gas, events and offersScratch Pad - a Free app that lets you write in free-hand.Doodle Blast - a free intro version of a paid game - fun for a day.ScoreMobile - Free Sports scores appQFolio - a Free Nasdaq stock appThe Big Package - a central app for free that allows you to track packages from different delivery companies in one site.Navita Translator and Fancy Tran - two free translation apps that are actually pretty goodGames:  Hangman, Free  solitaire, Playbook Chess, Gravity Burst Lite, Fruits and Ninjas, NYT Crosswords (all free apps)Currency - free currency converter.Netflix Queue Manager - meant to handle Netflix download queue.So far I am pretty happy.Just hoping the Android app interface rolls soon.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry Playbook 16 gb", "Author": "Christopher R. Cole", "ReviewID": "R3HBBVLG9FOI2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Playbook as a Christmas present from my parents, sister, and wife. I am completely new to the world of tablet computers, but have been a BlackBerry user for the past two and a half years. So when I saw that my family gave me a Playbook, I was very excited. I must say as I have spent the better part of the day playing with this fantastic device. My family really did their research on this. Being a BlackBerry user, the Playbook pairs via Bluetooth with my phone to access some of its features that, curiously, does not come pre-installed such as the calendar and the email app. Regardless of that though, mobile web has never looked so good. Where I believe the Playbook really shines is in its browser. You don't get a mobile view of a website, you get the full site. And unlike an iPad, the browser on the Playbook supports Flash, which the majority of the internet is. What's the point of having the \"best\" supposedly if it's handicapped by a deliberate lack of something essential? But the more I handle this, the more I am realizing that it does everything a tablet computer should do, and does it well. To say that I am impressed is an understatement. Even for someone who has had limited exposure to a touchscreen keyboard, I am finding the learning curve to be very friendly. The swipe feature, like the dots (which other BlackBerry users will be used to) allows you to do just about everything you will need to do. And as the final testament to what I have done with this so far, I typed this review on my Playbook.Edit: It's only been a couple of days but I need to update this review. I live in an area where the least expensive wi-fi option is $50 and comes with a 5gb cap. So, having my phone's unlimited data plan has been great at keeping me connected to the internet and the outside world. Where the Playbook comes into this is I can connect it to my phone (Curve 9330) via Bluetooth and use my existing data plan to surf the full web without having to add tethering to my plan. While slower than wi-fi, considering that I am able to see the full web without incurring extra fees and shelling out extra money, the trade-off is worth it.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome appendage for os7 phones", "Author": "the donut man", "ReviewID": "RF20XZU7SVC3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I jumped on the bandwagon and picked up a 32g at the discounted price.

A new owner finds out quickly that the Playbook is a proudly Canadian device. And that's kind of cool. No pun intended. Why? The supplied apps are Canadian-centric! Like the Film Board of Canada video app, Kobe bookstore or the ING.ca banking app in App World. Eh?Research in Motion is pedaling hard right now. We all know that.  Android and iOS rule the roost with Microsoft threatening to move Windows into position that might someday translate into a reasonable tablet. In the meanwhile, RIM's foot is stuck on the railroad tracks hoping some RCMP Mounties in the form of a Pandora or Skype can rescue it before the train arrives.And while the Mounties may, indeed show up, I'm betting they'll be in the form of independent players, Pandora SDK in hand, hunkered down in a cabin on the shore of Chaleur Bay in a flannel shirt hoping to get an app into the market that can stop the train. In the meanwhile, based on the recent RIM leadership shakeup and much needed Playbook upgrade to QNX 2.0, I think that the train is still very far away.I now have two of these $199 Canadian slabs sitting before me. One for me, one for my wife.  So for less than the price of one 10\" 8GB iPad, I have two 7\" 16GB Playbooks complete with USB, Bluetooth and HDMI support - connectivity features that, while unimportant to Apple in the era of `The Cloud', are important to me and lots of others.From a hardware standpoint, the Playbook is a lot of kit. When compared to a similarly priced Amazon Kindle Fire or the new 8GB B&N; Nook Tablet, just the connectivity features alone clearly give value-added benefits to the Playbook. Being a lazy writer, I'll spare you the rundown of the specs but I'll just say that this thing is solid. Really solid. Battleship solid. A bit heavy for small hands solid. And, with its metal chassis, a little cold too. If you like to cuddle up in the bedroom with your tablet perched on your mid-section, a B&N; Color Nook tab might be more comfortable. However, if you appreciate survivability, this thing is tough. But lacking Gorilla Glass, not that tough.A while ago I had the agony of owning an awful HTC Droid Eris running Android 2.1. While I'm not comparing apples to oranges or phones to tablets, I am calling out Google for the lack of stewardship of its Android OS by letting the phone manufacturers and carriers have their way with it and generally turn it into a fragmented, insecure cheeseball of an OS. It's so out of control with fragmentation and OEM customization that it reminds me of current day Las Vegas after the Mob lost control of the casinos. It's an overblown OS while Apple's iOS looks like it was designed by a New-Age artist at a Yanni concert.  I have a Windows Phone 7 which I think is the most usable mobile OS available. Looking closely at QNX, I saw that it was designed in the same spirit of OS usability, purity and security as old WebOS or Windows Phone 7.So let's talk about that operating system, QNX. A while back when HP was dumping their tablets for $99 bucks, having WebOS rather than Android or iOS was seen as a compromise to be made for the pleasure of scoring a nice albeit cheap tablet. What is sad is that WebOS is a very good OS. It's the same for Playbook's QNX. A very nice, secure and fast tablet environment bereft of malware and Android security fears. Using it gives you the impression that you are dealing with an extension of the quality build of the device's hardware. With the upgrade to 2.0, all of the previous dumb RIM management decisions melt away and you're gifted with a highly-functional tablet experience that doesn't need a Blackberry phone to provide integrated email and PIM features. In fact, QNX 2.0 gives the Playbook the smooth, effortless and snappy feel that is lacking in the Amazon Kindle Fire for the same money.Reading to this point, you'd think I'm really sold on our new Blackberry Playbooks. Well I'm certainly not going to put them in the box and send them back, but I have one serious concern that would have prevented me from buying the pair had they not been such a deal at $199 each.  Lack of apps.Now I refer you to back to my second paragraph. The section where I expect a Canadian Mountie in the form of a big player like Pandora or Skype to pull stuck RIM off the tracks before the train comes. Having business tools like Documents To Go is great, but it's not enough. Pandora says no. Skype is waiting to see if it's worth their while. But some like Zinio who see the promise of small but growing market are jumping in.Lacks of app was an issue with Windows Phone 7, and the outcry for Pandora was met by Indy developers creating SDK-based apps like MetroRadio to fill the hole. I think this is where Blackberry needs to be very proactive in supporting and fostering independent developer interest in Playbook and QNX. Just the ability to use some Android apps doesn't cut it. I've loaded a few. Feh. Playbook-native, quality apps built by RIM-supported developers are the only way to go to make RIM a true contender for your tablet-dollars.I'm keeping my Playbook. My wife hasn't put hers down since she got it, so I think she is too. But proactively I've put both Google and Bing on news alerts looking for Blackberry Playbook announcements. I'm reading Crackberry.com every day. So for now, the apps I have along with the great WebKit browser are satisfactory. But without a rapidly growing App World inventory, the future will be dim indeed.I have faith that the freight train heading for RIM will either derail or turn back before insuring a tragic and unnecessary ending to a great Canadian company.

It was bad enough that to acquire and use the most basic and universally popular apps, I had to spend hours standing on my head, tweaking my PC, and researching Java info (I am NOT a techie) to put it all together; it was worse when the only market for buying and viewing movies and shows was the ridiculous Roxio market and its antiquated, user-hostile site.But when, less than 5 months after purchase, my Playbook went the way of countless others, refusing to take a charge and eventually dying for the last time, I had it.

Blackberry did a lot of things right with this, as compared to other 7\" tablets out there.  I should explain that I bought the Playbook as a replacement for my Kindle Fire for several reasons.  (And yes, I do recognize that Amazon never officially marketed the Fire as a \"tablet\".)1) I LOVE my Blackberry phone and based on its quality and intuitiveness, had some faith ahead of time in the Playbook's craftsmanship and usefulness.2) The Kindle Fire's limited device memory makes me crazy, and don't tell me about Cloud storage.  That is of greatly diminished value without 3G service.  No, Amazon could not have afforded to offer this for free with the Fire, but they could have made it an option which I would gladly have paid for, much as I do on my iPad.  In any event, the Playbook I selected (32GB) offers quadruple the device memory as the Kindle for only 25% more money.3)  No camera on the Fire; front and rear-facing on the Playbook.  You DO need good lighting for a decent shot, however.  My phone takes a much better picture and compensates with a flash for darker scenes.4)  The Blackberry Bridge option which synced in a wink all the data on my Torch 9810, and the option to tether the tablet to my phone for 3G service (yes, at an additional charge.)So far I have decided the Fire is going up on eBay, but the jury is still out on whether or not I'll return the Playbook.PROS-Much larger memory than the Fire-Terrific graphics-Icons laid out on desktop in the usual manner.  Sorry, I find the Fire's carousel approach silly and unwieldy, and have the impression it was used for the sole purpose of doing something different (whether it was a better idea or not.)-Menus and page minimization super easy to manipulate.-File manager from which I can access .pdfs, pictures, music, etc.  Nice to have it centralized and files of all types neatly listed.-True stereo output, with speakers on BOTH sides (unlike the Fire).  Sound quality is impressive.-Option for use with a separate keyboard, though RIM severely underproduced the most reliable keyboard out there.  Cheaper versions seem to have mixed reviews.  Regardless, a reliable external keyboard could effectively turn the Playbook into a respectable netbook IMO.-Reasonably priced-USB cable makes loading music, documents, etc. from both my office PC and home iMac a breeze.CONS (and why it might go back)-NO KINDLE APP!!  Seriously??  For the first time, Amazon has managed to majorly disappoint me.  The company shot off its mouth over a year ago that one would be available for the Playbook, but no.

How could I resist? Well, I went ahead and bought it and I do like and dislike a few things about it.I really love the hardware quality of this tablet. It feels so whole and sturdy. This is the first BlackBerry device I've ever used, and I can see why they have such a loyal fanbase even in this day and age when Google, Apple, and Microsoft are eating away at their market share. I especially love the play/pause button on top of the tablet. That's quite useful. The matte finish on the back of the unit really gets me, because I love matte finishes on high quality devices. It certainly does not feel cheap, either. This is a well-put together tablet, and BlackBerry is even nice enough to include a neoprene sleeve with your PlayBook to give it basic protection.I was a little surprised at the lack of buttons for functions like forward or home, but I got used to the gestures rather quickly. They make a lot of sense, or at least for the most part (swiping from the bottom upward to close the app drawer is the only gesture that makes no sense to me, because swiping from the top down when the app drawer is open only opens the (very useful) settings drawer).The built-in apps are polished and well-made. Browser is very reliable, as well as the onboard camera, file manager, picture browser, video player, and more. It also does a wonderful job with my calendar sync and it syncs my contacts and emails quite well. Standby battery life is also very excellent. I had it sitting in my messenger bag for the past 8 hours and it still has 92% battery left from light use. The built-in keyboard is quite nice and makes a very nice, loud, satisfying tap sound when you press a key. When you type in certain apps or in the browser, the keyboard opens up this prediction system that reminds me of SwiftKey on Android, which is also rather nice.The built-in storage amount is by far the best feature of this tablet to me. So much space for so many videos, songs, and pictures. It's wonderful. You can go crazy with 64GB of storage. I have several videos in the .wmv format inside of it right now, but there's definitely more space available, and other supported formats. You could also use that space for games, which BlackBerry World seems to have no shortage of, as far as I can tell.Now, there are a few things I dislike about the item, but that doesn't necessarily mean I don't like the item as a whole.First of all, the app selection is awful and even non-existent to some degree. A lot of big names are completely absent on this platform for some reason. No official Dropbox, Netflix, Springpad, Kindle, nook, Pandora, Feedly, and a whole lot of other apps are missing. On a platform like Windows 8 or Windows Phone 8, whenever there's no official app, there's at least a very good third party app that is good enough or even better. That is not the case on the BlackBerry Playbook. If there's no app, chances are you have a questionable third-party app that actually costs money and has bad reviews, or nothing at all. You can sideload .bar files, but judging by the ported apps I've tried, they barely work or are poorly optimized for the PlayBook. It makes me wish people other than just game developers had given the PlayBook more of a chance. The hardware is definitely nice, but the software support from third parties was definitely not there.I also own a Nexus 7, and the app selection on the PlayBook (unfortunately) pales in comparison. I think that's a shame as well, because I like the look and feel of the PlayBook's hardware more. I don't play a lot of games, either, but it seems like the apps that are most plentiful on the PlayBook (or just about any tablet) are the games. There's even a few preinstalled on the PlayBook, like Tetris or Need For Speed, in case you want to get used to the UI on it.I'm not a fan of the security on the tablet, either. I'm not talking about stuff like viruses or any of that. No, BlackBerry's very much on the ball when it comes to that kind of security. The security I'm talking about is locking the tablet. If you have a Nexus 7, iPad, or just about any other device, you can set up a convenient and rather easy way to unlock the device so that only the owner or those who know the password/pin/pattern can get access. Well, if you only like password lock screens, then you will have no problem at all with the PlayBook. This is the only way to lock the device, to my knowledge. I looked around in the settings and can't find anything else. Instead of being able to quickly press a few numbers, or draw out a pattern, I have to use the entire keyboard and type something out, and after that, reach for the \"OK\" or \"Enter\" key. You can just use a pin for the password, but it's still more effort than it needs to be. I wish this required a bit less effort, although it's not a deal killer for me. It's partly a problem because this is a tablet instead of a smartphone, so the screen is bigger and takes more effort to type a simple password on.Lastly, some of the UI is a bit counter-intuitive to me, or at least at first. This is my first BlackBerry device, and I am willing to admit if I just found it counter-intuitive because I'm unfamiliar with BlackBerry's UI standards. It took me a while to figure out how to set a wallpaper for the tablet. I kept searching the settings thinking it had to be close, until a Google search showed me I had to go to the pictures app and do it from there. Also, it seems like to get settings on any app, you need to swipe from the top down, which isn't too obvious unless you've used the tablet for a long time or just already know what to expect.Although this tablet has shortcomings and is aging a bit, it is still an unbeatable value for its storage and out-of-box media capabilities. Good luck finding a new 64GB tablet at that price. I store tons of video on mine and use it primarily as a dedicated media tablet. For media playback and capabilities, this tablet is more than adequate for the job. Just don't count on using too many apps. If you want to watch videos, play music, or look at pictures on the go, and you want a lot of storage to do so, go for the PlayBook. You won't be disappointed you did.EDIT: I've been using it a bit more lately with sideloaded apps I've put into the tablet myself. Some of these are a bit wonky to get working (older versions, free apps only, etc.), but some of them do work great or good enough. RetroArch works perfectly on the PlayBook (to my knowledge, I haven't actually opened up a ROM in it), and the Dropbox app I sideloaded as a .bar file works fine, too. But the strangest thing is that you probably need to sideload apps to get quality compared to the ported apps on BlackBerry World. For example, I use Electro Droid on my Android devices, and there's an app called Electro Tools in BlackBerry World that looks like a ported app. The ported app in BBW is terrible and barely works at all, but if you sideload Electro Droid as a .bar file, it works perfectly.Sadly, you can't sideload everything on this tablet. I've tried sideloading SpringPad twice already, but it doesn't even show up on my apps list. Still, your results may vary on this, but it's quite capable on running sideload apps. I partly wish that sideloading didn't require setting a password on this tablet (a password is required for using the tablet in development mode, which you need to sideload anything).", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got one that was supposed to be new but was not", "Author": "Mary Garvey", "ReviewID": "R2QCHOXX20QOX3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to return it..I got it from Time to Save..perhaps there is a glitch but I could not set it up or register it and called Blackberry Support..they said serial number had a valid registration and this was not a new item..it looked new..no scratches etc....I went back to web site to see if it said refurbished anywhere and did not see it.I am sending back and hopefully will not have further trouble with another one.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's the best I come across", "Author": "Avelon Manswell", "ReviewID": "R23UAM4YUJCE1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't get enough of itCan't put it down go out and get one.

I use it mainly to read email, browse the web, track stocks and watch youtube.Let's start with my worst experience, the YouTube.  The layout seems ok, until you start do a search on video.  It cannot find video that exist when using web browser.  I am talking about the browser on BB.  That's pointless, right?  it is not just one instance.  It happens a lot.  So, I end up using the browser to go to YouTube .  Secondly, the \"related\" video and the authors link feature doesn't work!!  So, after you watch one video, and wants to find the related video or author button.  It just won't allow you to do it.  Even WebOS is better, what is this?Second main comment is the lack of good stocks, options tracking software.  It isn't hard to program.  Since RIMM is targeting business users, they should include more finance related good apps.Third, the screen and video quality is not as good as HP TouchPad.  the pixel density seems less.

My expectation is that any important OS updates RIM provides for the 32 and 64 gig models will also apply to the 16 gig models.Background:  My use of the Playbook is primarily for business, so that perspective largely impacts my review.Value: Excellent value for the hardware and software that comes with the Playbook.  That's why I don't mind tossing a few bucks for some apps, altho I'd prefer to pay more up front and not have to search for some essential apps, some of which have shortcomings.OS and Blackberry Support of the OS:  Software/Installation Process Should Be BetterThe RIM websites devoted to the Playbook have some useful instructional videos, but these websites are also disorganized and unnecessarily confusing in areas.I'd prefer to have the option of updating the OS using the USB cable and the Blackberry software I can access from the RIM site(s).The on-board standard file manager that comes with the Playbook is very limited and doesn't show many files and folders on the Playbook.  (I've been trying out some file manager apps from the Blackberry Appworld.)  For limited file management, one can also change the Playbook's \"Storage and Sharing\" settings or use the the Blackberry Desktop software installed on a laptop/desktop in conjunction with a USB cable connected to Playbook.The Playbook has a .pdf reader installed, as well as Docs to Go, which includes mobile versions of MS Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.  Trying to open versions of a document that I had created in the MS Word format as well as the .pdf format, the .pdf reader provided better readability, showing page numbers and a signature, whereas Docs to Go did not.  Opening a PowerPoint file that contained audio, Docs to Go showed the slides but did not recreate the audio.  Perhaps there are apps or other software I could procure to address this shortcomingThe Playbook allows me to tether via Bluetooth to a Nokia smartphone that connects to a Tmobile data service.  This arrangement works very well, the connection remaining unbroken for 2-4 hours on occasion.  However, certain apps, such as the Playbooks App World app won't work with this type of connection, but will work with a WiFi connection.Using the default video recording settings created files of about 4 gigs in size during an hour and a half of recording.  Because I don't do much digital video recording, I can't validly compare the Playbook's capabilities in this area with similarly priced instruments.Recently, I bought the OEM Blackberry charging stand, which has been reviewed on the Amazon website.  I will probably buy the OEM Blackberry bluetooth keyboard, which altho pricier than most of the alternatives, probably works considerably better with the Playbook, based on many reviews I have read.AFAIK, the Playbook doesn't come with a password manager.  I paid 1.99 or 2.99 for the Vault, from Xlabz.  This works fairly well.  However, this software provides for offsite backing up, using DropBox.  This is a step I don't want to take, because of my security concerns re: Dropbox.  I'm hoping that a more comprehensive file manager will allow me to find one or more password manager files on the Playbook that I can use for onsite backing up of the password manager.As others have mentioned, the music player combined with the Playbook's speakers work well in light of the device's speaker size limitations.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "Fano", "ReviewID": "R1HSC6ZE3RY8FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's the better tablet in the market.

I love the Blackberry Bridge which allows me to look at pics and files on my Blackberry Torch smartphone.  Using the BB forums I learned that when I have a pic up on my Playbook I can press the -/+ buttons on the top, get a snapshot of the pic and it saves to my PB library.  I can also use the \"tethering\" function and get internet connectivity through my smartphone!  I can link up to my PC wirelessly with my PB and upload and download files never leaving my sofa or interrupting hubby while he's on the computer.

What else does this tablet have to make it worth buying? The camera and battery life. Every scenic picture taken with the camera makes it look interesting. Makes the scenic pictures that would have been a boring looking picture, into something that you wonder \"where is that\". Makes the photo look like a whole different world. The battery, not sure if you can get a tablet with a better battery life, at this point. Does last a long time. Another thing people may not like is the boot up time. Sometime you just want to be able to turn it in really quick and play your favorite game. I think that slow boot up somehow helps out alot with the battery life though. Since. Not a problem for me.

Yes you can get a bridge between your phone and the playbook but all you need is a Blackberry ID, which is mainly necessary for the App world.

It's the ads that cause the bulk of crashing & the slowness. The good thing is that when it crashes, reopening it will put you on the last thing you were looking at. There are several other 3ed party browsers you can install.Proxybrowser: The only browser AdBlocker works on, because it comes with it. The downside is that won't play videos. Still, the lack of ads improve browsing speed & stability greatly.Facebook: Don't even try to play Facebook games on this thing; it will crash every time. It can't handle the workload.Youtube/Blip: Half of the time, when an ad plays in the middle of the video, it will play the ads over & over, then reset the video to the beginning or end it.Battery life: 4 hours tops, unless you turn off WiFi when you're not using it.Free games: You'll have to spend a few books to find anything good. Most of the free games are duplicates, aimed at detracting drooling 2 year olds, or the most mediocre games in their native Chinese, Spanish, & Russian languages.Camera: Fill a fish bowl full of cocoa; that's what your pictures will look like. Not unlike that weird orangeness old cellphone cameras have.Java support: None; there goes your plans to sideload Minecraft.Software updates: Haven't been any since I bought it, so Flash is several versions behind.Blackberry Desktop Software: I've never gotten this thing to successfully connect to my desktop. Even their tech support gave up trying to help me.Primary uses: It still does the little things I wanted it for; Play solitaire in bed as a pre-sleep ritual, access Yelp/email/Google Maps on vacation, has a screen 3x the size of an iPad, & isn't an Apple or Microsoft product.

Consider it a free tablet after a couple of months.  I have unlimited data on my phone plan and being able to access the internet without additional charges pays for the Playbook after only a couple of months.  I have seen instances of data being slowed, but only in high use areas.  I only have 3G so I consider this pretty good.  I'm not a big app user.  I have seen some apps written for the ipad or android that I want.  I'm often put off that more android apps haven't yet migrated to the playbook or that android apps do not load transparently to the Playbook.  BB does a great job insuring security, but they need to speed up the app approval process.  The only area that has frustrated me in using the internet is that some, not all, drop down menus do not work on the playbook.  Hopefully, this will be resolved soon.  The above reasons are the only items that keep me from giving it five stars.  Movies are easily downloaded from my pc and I find the screen size decent for watching while flying.  The images are excellent.

Shame on you.", "Author": "Navid", "ReviewID": "R1L6FXYXL4HM68", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered two 64gb Playbooks through RIM's site (free shipping, no tax, figured the mfg stands behind its products if any issues arise).  My mistake.  Should have ordered via Amazon.com since they set the standard on customer care.  It would have cost a bit more, but I wouldn't have to waste my time writing this review.Again, I bought two Playbook's, both 64gb. One for me, the other for my wife since we're both BB 9900 and 9810 users and loyalists.  One Playbook was defective right out of the box.  It had a dead pixel, which by the way they said they couldn't do anything about because \"it's within our acceptable range\" for dead pixels.  I couldn't believe my ears.  It's like buying a new car with a crack on the windshield, and the dealership says \"that's ok, because we set our standards so low, that this is actually a good thing\".It didn't end there.  The device would also freeze up and not allow me to turn it off.  Then they refused to allow me to return both devices, even though the second device was still in the box, unopened.  They said they need to attempt to repair it, and they couldn't repair the dead pixel.  I have to live with that problem they said.  That process would have taken at least 3 weeks.  They also had the nerve to tell me to keep the unopened box device and use that one, and then they would take back the device with the problem.  I was thinking, \"seriously?\", do they think I'm that desperate or stupid?I guarantee you, Apple or any Android device maker wouldn't conduct their QC or customer service that way.Finally, I pretty much had to keep calling until they sent me a new device.  That device didn't come in the same packaging.  So now, I have a supposed \"new\" 64gb Playbook, with the box of the old one, which obviously doesn't have the same SN.  They called that the \"advanced exchange\".  To their defense, they did overnight that with a prepaid FedEx label for the device I returned.  But that's after putting a $699 retail price hold on my credit card.  I paid $299 for my device, but they put a hold of $699 on my credit card.  Figure that one out.  Nice, right?I've been a BB user for almost 10 years now.  I can't believe how quickly this company has gone from being the innovator in the space to the catastrophe of the space.If you're having trouble getting to customer support, try this number (877) 255.2377.  You'll need a case number and from that point, they're pretty good about denying responsibility for their subpar products.  It's a customer support nightmare.I'm now stuck with the two devices which I'm debating keeping.  I really did like the bridge feature and being able to access the internet while mobile, without having to pay for a 3G or 4G service.  But the lack of apps and so many other missing features, which the press has written about extensively makes it an unattractive device compared to what's available out there.  Not to mention all the technical issues the device has.RIM's third party fulfillment company GlobalWare Solutions said they've escalated my request to return the devices to their committee and they will decide if they'll send me an RMA with a prepaid shipping label.  Nice, huh?  No one has called me yet.  I'm in a big \"BLACK\"-BERRY hole.  Their number is (866) 957-0761, and they referred me to their BB technical support at (877) 644-8410, which then referred me to the BB website.  It's one clown short of a three-ring circus.Now you know why their stock price is where it is, and why customers are taking losses and getting rid of their devices, and to leave the mess this company has created for itself, and it's loyalists.Ridiculous if you ask me.  Not to mention, very embarrassing.You're bound to see more and more negative comments about customer experiences with the Playbook that will crush any attempts RIM will make to keep itself above water.  This thing is starting to unravel faster than they can do damage control.This product was not ready for launch, and they clearly rushed it due to pressure.  Now, instead of standing behind its products and reputation, and making things right for unhappy customers, it's deflecting accountability and responsibility and leaving the customer high and dry.Nice going RIM.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Playbook User for 4 Days", "Author": "Todd Snelgrove \"Global Manager; Value\"", "ReviewID": "RGRNV1YCRQ325", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it.

Everything is hard.Seeing as the entire point of a tablet is simplicity, I found this aspect really odd.An example: You can download your photos quite easily from another computer, which is nice to cart around old pics you like to have around. But while with an ipad or galaxy, then viewing them, and moving between them, is ease itself, with the playbook, it's a struggle. There might be an app that makes this work, but I've been through four and nothing is satisfactory. I never for a minute considered that this might be a problem. It isn't with anything else I own. after all.And there are the truly bizarre, no Skype, no Netflix, both you'd think would be included in any product today.The technical support is poor. And on...When it does what I expected it to do, it does it well. But right now, it's a reader and email machine with a USB stick functionality.

I am just happy as can be with the Playbook. Granted, it's not perfect and the apps are few right now. Quite baren almost...but it's got some help on the way as RIM is giving these out to Android developers willing to port their apps over to the Playbook.The Playbook has fast hardware, ample storage, and a great UI. The apps available on the Playbook are basic but elegant. I almost felt like I was using something with an Apple logo on it, everything is sharp and fast. The mutlitasking nature of the tabbed UI is just so inuitive it's literally a fine example of the work these guys do.I researched tablets for quite a while, thinking over such options as the Kindle Fire, Nook Color, Galaxy Tab, and Toshiba Thrive. After hashing over what was more preferable - screen size, hardware, and build quality - I narrowed it down to just the smaller units. Personally, anything over 7 inches doesn't feel like a real tablet.  I liked the Nook and Kindle for that reason. Ultimately, I chose this because of the price. It's an incredible deal for what you're getting. No GPS though, which kinda foiled my plan of using it as a big GPS nav. But I do just about love it for everything else it offers.This is only the 2nd day owning this tablet but I'm very happy with the device and the experience is awesome. I'm coming from 2+ years of Android experience, 2 years Windows Mobile before that, and frankly speaking it's all more or less moving in the same direction.

I don't know if what I did made the difference, but .... with wifi on and connected I enabled pop-ups.  Then I used the cloud reader link on the \"app/link\" page I'd created earlier, went to downloaded books (I'd \"downloaded\" four)and opened one and read some.  Pages don't turn well but it's doable if not fun.  Then I turned off the wireless but did NOT close the browser and was able to go back to it and continue reading.  However, I found that if you close the browser app you're done for; poof, it's all gone when you reopen it and you have to enable/connect the wifi and start all over again to get back to your book.  Oh, and Bing maps has finally more or less located me - twice and briefly - a few blocks from my actual location.Update:  Upon further reflection I'm going to upgrade the rating to .... 3 stars, I think.  It does a nice job with photos and videos (and music) and I don't expect something of this size to be much of a \"work machine\", just more of a fun \"take along\" as RugRat says, something in size between my iPhone (too small for much photo/video stuff) and my iPad (too big for a purse)and with somehow a sleeker feel and a little more easy versatility than my Kindle Fire.  Yahoo (sbcglobal) and gmail access work, web browsing is fine.  BUT - the location service still doesn't work, Blackberry tech support gets NEGATIVE stars, and the biggest problem - a deal-breaker really - is that I can't read my Kindle books without internet access.  I'm not going to carry around TWO 7\" tablets, and in the war of Books vs Videos Books win hands down.Original Review:  I've had this for two days and so far I like the look and feel but not much else.  I've done two hard resets and made three calls to tech support who were if possible worse than useless.  On the first call I got a live person, I asked a question, was put on hold and disconnected after 6 minutes.  The second call disconnected AT the transfer, and on the third call I got a human again who mostly said things like \"yeah, maybe\" and \"I don't know\" and couldn't even explain or walk me through some of the basic steps I'd already done.  So far Bing Maps cannot \"locate\" me - at all - even though the other GPS-less but wifi devices next to it can.  Granted they are sometimes a few blocks off, but the Playbook just says \"unable to locate - please try later\" (I think trying repeatedly over two days is enough). And, try as I might, I've been unable to read - or even find - my supposedly \"downloaded to the device\" Kindle books while offline despite hours of searching and trying possible online \"solutions \" or work-arounds. They may have worked for some, but not on the unit I have.  When I asked the Blackberry rep for help with this issue he clearly didn't have any idea and first had me go through a bunch of things I'd already done that didn't work.  When I really pressed him on the subject - because if I can't figure out a way to do this I'm most likely returning it - he put me on hold for a few minutes and came back to say there was \"no way I could read the Kindle books on the playbook.\"", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Be aware of extra charge to tether to your phone", "Author": "ColoMom", "ReviewID": "RZVAFGQYQ78PP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently bought this from the manufacturer on sale.  I have been looking at various notebooks for a while but no way would I pay $600 (I got the 32 GB) for any of them.  I really wanted it for travel so I would not need to take my laptop with me and didn't necessarily need to find a wi-fi hotspot on the road.  I chose the playbook for a couple of reasons--1)  I really like the size of it (about as big as a half-sheet of paper)very easily fits in my purse 2) I liked the idea that you could tether it to your Blackberry phone for data (the idea, of course, being that I didn't have to buy a separate data plan.)  That second reason for buying it is why I am only giving it 3 stars--what they don't tell you (or, at least I never saw anywhere, is that you have to PAY EXTRA to tether it to your phone for data (or at least with ATT you do)--so much for not having to buy another plan!!  I don't know yet how much as I haven't had to travel since getting it and have just been using it with wi-fi, I just thought I'd try it and that is how I discovered the need for an extended plan.  This is fairly annoying to me!!  Otherwise, I do like it, it does easily sync information (like notepad, etc) with the phone and if you're on a wi-fi network, connects and browses well on the internet.  As other reviewers noted, it is a little short on apps but there are still quite a few--enough anyway to make me happy enough and my kids have had great fun playing on it.  So anyway, even if I end up not paying extra to tether to my phone to it, I guess it can provide entertainment when we're traveling!  Just thought a little heads up on the data plan would be nice.**update**  haven't tried this yet but another reviewer recommended looking at crackberry.com/playbook-bridge to get around the tethering issue.  I looked at it and think that will probably work for me.  If it does I will likely be back to raise my rating to 4 or maybe even 5 stars.  This really is a neat little item!**more update**well, I've tried several workarounds to this issue none of which worked for me.  Probably who I should ding is ATT not the playbook but anyway this isn't going to work for right now the way I wanted it to so I'm not really happy either way. ATT customers, at least, need to be aware of this issue.  (BTW $45/mo tethering plan w/ATT IN ADDITION TO (the way I understand it) your regular data plan.

The primary reason for buying it was the promise of android apps. I thought that the OS looks good, and with a choice of apps, it is a steal, considering the hardware. How very wrong i was!The hardware is indeed great for the price. You get 2 cameras, a stunning display, a 1ghz dual core processor and 1 gig of RAM. The OS, for the most part, does a great job of using this hardware potential. So what's the problem?Apps, as you might have guessed. What use are 2 cameras when you don't even get skype, or any other video chat app, coming to think of it. Yeah, there is the official video chat, but it is works only with playbooks playbook,rendering it more or less useless.Appworld is a joke, seriously! I did see a lot of new apps after the release of OS 2.0, but most of them are completely useless. Most look as if devs made them only to get a free playbook.No kindle, no netflix, hulu, no decent note taking app except evernote, not even google maps. What they have, like angry birds, are overpriced. $4.99 for angry birds,really?? It appears that devs are not too interested in making any apps for the playbook.So comparing to iOS or android, the apps selection is ludicrous.Problem is, no improvement is in sight.The android apps were only the ones devs submitted, which does not seem to be a large number.There are some games, but the collection is very limited.The android app player can get temperamental at times.On the plus side, the OS is actually snappy. Closing an app is as easy as it gets. The video and sound quality is pretty good, so is office app.If all you need is a device that you could put in your pocket and use for email, reading and editing word and excel docs and surf the net?( with wifi), this is the device for you.

I have had my 32GB wifi model for about a week.  (I bought it from Staples.)  The physical tablet is four and half stars.  It is a perfect size, the screen is beautiful and the weight is ideal.  It is roughly the same size as a 3d generation Kindle.  Half a star deduction for the top buttons which do not feel like they are very high quality.Included in the box are some brief instructions, a folding blade charger, a micro-usb cable, a nice foam pouch case, and a screen wipe.There are a few negatives: (1) a lot of websites think the browser is for a blackberry phone and auto-direct you to the mobile version of their website; (2) the browser does not allow you to rename bookmarks, reorder bookmarks, or put bookmarks into folders; (3) the GPS is not yet functional - it's in there, but has not been enabled by the firmware - this feature is \"coming soon\"; (4) there are two very high quality cameras, but no videochat software; (5) there is no Kindle App.When linked to your blackberry smartphone via bluetooth you get a mirror of the email, contacts, calendar, to do, and memo pad found on your phone.  You also get access to files on your blackberry (even the microSD), but cannot open video or audio files - just documents.  There is something called the \"bridge browser\" which allows you to surf the internet through your phone's web browser and 3G connection.  This is different from tethering because the carriers don't charge for it.  The PlayBook also allows tethering which gives you full data access (although not to app world for some reason).  Some carriers charge for tethering, some don't.  Apparently AT&T; doesn't even allow their customers to use the Bridge - which is a HUGE drawback if you happen to have AT&T.;The lack of apps is the largest drawback.  As of this writing, there is no Kindle app (a huge drawback), no Skype app, no Netflix app, and no MLB app.  You cannot watch Netflix videos on the browser or your MLB.tv subscription.  You CAN watch amazon instant videos.  They look beautiful.There is a huge amount of potential, but unfortunately a lot of that is \"coming soon\" - and isn't there right now.  When is \"soon\"?  Nobody knows.  One good thing is that firmware updates come out every few days and each adds functions.  Since there are no carriers involved in rolling out firmware, RIM has full control and can do it quickly.Some have mentioned problems with battery charging - I haven't had that.  My battery charges pretty quickly and goes to 100%.  I can use it for nearly 15 hours before I get a low battery warning with about 10% left.  Some have complained about the power button being hard to push.  Mine is small and recessed, but I can easily push it.The screen is absolutely beautiful.You can use your existing blackberry charger, but it will take much longer to charge.  The included charger can charge your existing blackberry (micro USB) without harm.  There is also an available quick-charging stand.The BlackBerry PlayBook could be an amazing tablet - five stars.

None of the .MKV videos work and some of the .AVIs won't work at all while others show a silent movie that I attribute back to whatever it is that won't play audio files.3) The fastest loading page on the web is arguably the Google home page at [...]  On the Playbook this page takes 3-4 minutes to load with the Playbook within arm's length of the wireless router. The Playbook is touted for having Flash support but only after I turned Flash off and JavaScript off would Google load in a few seconds.4) Blackberry Bridge: Doesn't work for me. Although this not working may be attributable to my using a Blackberry that's a few years old and doesn't have as much memory as the latest, the bottom line is that it still didn't work because my Blackberry phone did not have enough memory to run the required software and I'm not about to go out and buy a new Blackberry phone just to make the Playbook work.and more5) Screen sensitivity: Almost half the time the screen would not respond to my finger swipes and pokes.

Here's the problem with this playbook ... the Blackberry Playbook App Store is terrible, very... very... very... LIMITED SELECTION of apps. available for this unit.  Here's the details of my issues, if anyone has a fix / solution or recommendation, please advise.The Facebook playbook app is way-outdated and doesn't work right. No Pandora, iHeart Radio, Songza, Spotify, iTunes playbook apps available.  No Hulu, Netflix, Ebay or Amazon playbook apps available.  No Google apps available, Maps, Gmail, etc.  No e-reader apps that are any good.  In addition ... GPS location services and Bluetooth are not working correctly.  And the touch screen is not always responsive.So what is good and what apps are working?  So far ... YouTube, Twitter and Slacker Radio and the apps from Blackberry for their Music Store and Video Store, plus the Accuweather app ... all appear to working as they should.  The build quality is good, LCD screen is bright, front facing stereo speakers are really nice, camera works great, e-mail and BB messaging work good (after you set up accounts of course).  The browser works OK, a little slow ... but viewing websites on a small 7\" tablet without an app. ... is just stupid.  So...  Unless Blackberry decides to update their App Store for The Playbook ... don't waste your money.  Buy an Apple iPad Mini or a Samsung Galaxy Tab or a Google Nexus or A Kindle, Nook or a great E Reader - anything other than this Playbook.

IMO it is not worth the price if one cannot do what you need ....email= no problem using yahoo & gmail.boarding passes = sometimes it works sometimes not. many times i cannot get the curser into box or the small windows to choose dates that pop up freeze or i can't make a choice = i end up using 3g on cell.hotel/plane reservation= same problem as boarding pass = end up using 3g on cell.maps = fair to so-so  .. if you are looking at a resturant and they provide a map ( google or bing) and i click on map it pops up a new browser page and it freezes and i have to cloes it. = end up using google maps on cell ... anyway i get to google maps it doesn't work = freezes ... going to BING and clicking on maps = freezes.the playbook does have a bing map app. that works so-so to ok . problem there is say i'm looking at santa monica and i click on resturants. it shows 7 ( 1-7) resturants on map. i can click next page and now it shows 8-14 on map ..finally by page 6 i see my resturant say #44 .. i then zoom into map and by the time i can see the street name the resturants have reset to 1-7 .. i then jump to page 6 and now the map is zoomed out and my resturant isn't there because now it might be #30 or #40 or #9 .. seems to change every time and again once i zoom into map it always goes back to page 1 on listings ..surfing the net = so-so ..many times the pop ups do not work, hard to get curser into boxes, pages do not load or do not work ( freezes )the playbook is set up to work with a blackberry phone. i do have a wifi hotspot on my cell. no problem with playbook connecting to it but in the end it's not good enough here ... i've been on 3 trips since i've had the playbook and every trip i've ended up using my cell to finish up what the playbook couldn't.i've been told that OS V2 mid feb 2012 will fix it.oh lets not forget about the on/off button. it's a pain .. i can press on it for 5, 10 , 20 seconds and nothing. not sure what pressure turns it on?  you can turn it off without using the button BUT the only way to turn it on is using it. right after i bought it i went to 2 stores that carried playbook to see if mine had a problem. both stores had playbooks on display and none worked. last week i went by 3 stores and again NONE worked. these are not display models they are suppose to be working playbooks. i did find one at a best buy begin of Jan and the ON button was worse then mine. so i just don't turn it off. i find that after approx 3 days of not using it - it is very difficult to wake up.other then the ON button the hardware seems to be very good to excellent. HDMI easily connects to TV, projector.IMO it's the software that needs work. hoping V2 makes it usable ..not a happy playbook owner ( yet)update 4/9/2012upgraded to 2.0 ..no problem making plane/hotel /boarding pass, reservations ..bing maps works much better ... google maps still does not work ...takes over 3min to boot up ... seems to me, clicking on links is worse ( nothing happens)in OS 2 ..also i use to leave it in standby ( because it is difficult to turn ON) but since OS 2i find that after 24hrs in stand-by it is very difficult to get it out of stand-by and when i do, about 40% of the time it is frozen = have to restart ...still think the ON=OFF button is the WORST ..i'm not finding the \" it works with android apps\" working that well ...i do like the 7\" size ..IMO OS 2 is a slight improvement  ..today i take a 4.3\" android phone on trips (no cell service on it, only use WiFi ) instead of the playbook because it works much better ... take a 3.2\" android for cell phone use ...not a happy playbook owner ... use it less and less ...it's OK but OK is not good enoughupdated 9/23/12there was a small update in software since last april ..no longer have any problems getting it out of stand-by after 24hrs or even 4-5 days of stand-by... but now making reservations is difficult because 75% of the time i can't click on the icons to finish teh reservation or should i say i don't know if i clicked on the icon ? they don't highlight, i click on em and nothing happens but then i'll check my email 5 min later and see that i just made 3 reservations at the hotel or i bought 2 train tickets ? it never went to a confirm page when i was trying to make reservation ...BING maps is difficult to use with the new software update ( again can't click on the icons ) ... i now consider this thing USELESS ... if one can't click on icons then it sits there ...60% i can't go BACK to previous web page ... i pretty much stopped using it last april (2012) .. was thinking of taking it to europe next week but after trying it out last week it just can't complete reservations and it's a pain to surf the web  , will replace this with a android tablet when i return ... changed rating to 1 star ( from 2)  ..will never again buy a RIM product/service ..", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "detail", "ReviewID": "R25N7OH6XJ4PXU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "good seller,fast shipping. not one regret even as i had doubts before i purchased the item. i love the product", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I satisfy", "Author": "Patricia Merritt", "ReviewID": "R3MOGUEQBZ10AS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I received them they wAsnt working I was n't satisfy with  both tablet .

I've always liked Blackberry and am somewhat saddened by their fall from grace. I bought the device just to see what it was like after several dramatic price cuts. It's good, but it is not special. I also have an iPad that I disliked at first, but after buying the Playbook I find the iPad experience to be better. I've also played with Samsung's tablets and like them better than the iPad. The screen size is too small, which I knew going into the purchase. I feel that any device with 7-inch screen is not worth it. Playbook is pretty heavy and I don't like that either, but some people might find the weight difference marginal. The Blackberry App World is small and there isn't a single one that I have bought. The device now serves as an expensive web-browser for me, something I already get from my Kindle Fire and iPad. A final thought, the navigation around the menus and especially certain apps is not quite intuitive. I have found myself very confused and frustrated trying to exit a screen that doesn't have an exit button for me (the device itself doesn't have a home button either, something common with other tablets)...the exit is all in the swipe...somewhere...if you just know where the swipe spot is... Bottomline, I would recommend holding off until the device is much cheaper or just pay-up and get a competing device. Google Nexus, Samsung Tab or Apple iPad aren't much more expensive and the user experience is better.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Product didn't work", "Author": "Theresa Albertson \"can i be wise?\"", "ReviewID": "R2UEF7CHOR0NFU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had a technical difficulty with this items (some text was missing from a drop-down menu) so I couldn't use the device.

Sometimes my life seems to depend on it, so, I was really waiting for a product like this Playbook to be out in the market. I went to the closest Staples and got me one (16Gb for $499.00 + tax)...they had plenty of them anyway. The disappointment that fallowed is such a shame given the Tremendous Amount of Technology Packed in this Cool Gadget.Graphics: As said before...breathtaking, out of this world.Multitasking: Flawless...impressive.Speed: Darn fast!Set up: Ridiculously Easy.Network and Connectivity: Here is where the two stars come to play. Through the Wi-Fi connection it worked above my expectation. When paired through my BB Smartphone 8530 with software version 5.0 it was a mess. The internet connection was very slow and dropped every two minutes and also every time I tried to transfer a file through BB Bridge.  In addition, I manage my life through a personal Synology home server which normally I access smoothly anywhere in the world from my laptop. The BB Browser does not support the Synology application, therefore I could not access it.Business Apps: Very good if the paired connection to my smart phone didn't drop so many times.Size: Perfect.Everything on this tablet is perfect except the very two things I wanted it for Mobility and Remote Data aAccessibility.  Also, there is no way to pair the BB phone via a physical cord.So my bottom line is...if you are going to use this tablet for business...wait until they fix the glitches and lower the price. If you want this tablet to sit at your local coffee shop with a Wi-Fi connection and surf the net,then make a trip whenever you have the time and buy one, I guarantee, you will have an awesome experience and I guarantee there will be plenty waiting for you at the store.

If I haven't used it in a day or two and try to use it, its already dead from being in standby. Its plugged into the wall as I type, waiting for it to charge before cleaning it out and boxing it back to the store.My nook color can be in standby, with the same size screen, and a week later, its still got more than 1/2 batt full and ready to go when I need it.And we all know the legendary battery life of the iPad and A4 processor. The benchmark has been set.The playbook tiny round red and silver power button on the top is also annoying. Too small for my big fingernails. Need to carry around a pen tip.How to fix it?$299 with this current battery, and it may still not succeed, but I would probably keep it. Much better battery life is sorely needed along with a competitive price, especially since they are the underdog, and late to the game behind iOS, and Android.It's going back to the store this week, sad to say. Going the try the Acer 10\" $449 that just came out. See if batt life is better and if flash works on that.I worry that QNX will suffer the same fate as BeOS, Palm, and other great platforms that were acquired.RIM is lost and confused.

However, I have played with it considerably in the form of its software emulator.  I can speak of the hardware itself, since it was emulated by my desktop PC, and I can't speak of the apps themselves, since there were none; but what I was able to see was the web browser and user interface.  In that regards, the Playbook seems well laid out and organized, and it seems easy to use.  Compared to the iPad (which I've used only in the Apple store), there are neat gestures that increases the efficiency of the interface.  It took a while to realize that some actions are activated by gestures, but once you get the hang of it, the tablet becomes very fluid.  It would be nice to have a keyboard that can be reconfigured in terms of size.  It does take up a considerable portion of the screen, but given the intrinsic touchscreen interface and gestures, the keyboard is not going to be of primary concern.  Before I got involved in the developer's program, the Playbook didn't really interest me, but once I got a chance to use the software emulator, I have to admit that I'm looking forward to getting mine in the mail.  Hopefully I will be able to update this review soon, once I get it.UPDATE:  I got my free Playbook.  It is as fluid as I had expect, but having it my hand gives me a better feel on how it handles.  RIM went the 7\" format which both pros and con.  Obviously it make the UI smaller, but that is not necessarily the end all or be all of the design.  The smaller size makes this a very mobile, hand portable platform.  Moreover, the smaller screen size make everything much more smooth and crisp.  Given the landscape layout, rather than thinking of the devise has having a small screen, I think it's more appropriate to think if it as just the upper half of the iPad in portrait mode.The hardware is fast and smooth.  There is no lag, even with multiple apps open at the same time.  And the gestures make moving from app to app smooth and efforts.  The playbook still need some way to scroll, as with a trackpad, but otherwise this is a easy to use device.  My only wish is for a built-in GPS to make this a perfect travel companion.The software does need some tweaking, but this is not fundamental limitations.  Of course, the lack of an native email viewer is noticeable, but this is not a permanent situation and is a very fixable problem.  And, as so many have pointed out, there aren't as many apps as iOS or Android, but the number of apps is a false issue.  The real question is on RIMs strategy to attract developers and how does their hardware make app useful.  On the first, as a app developer myself,  my one concern is that RIM has a very awkward process to upload and maintain have apps.  It's no worse than Apple's, but Apple is in a position to maintain their arrogance.  Hopefuly RIM will cleanup their process as they go from \"catch up\" mode to \"polishing\" mode.  However, on the latter question on the hardware, I can say the the hardware and UI is very powerful, much better than that in iOS, and it should enable very, very nice apps.  And given RIM's enterprise level infrastructure, particularly with security, I think this could be a truly powerful business platform.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "The product is not user friendly.", "Author": "Wendy H Wang", "ReviewID": "R1CE3IONMAHB0U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the size.

Not only is blackberry app world lacking in polished applications, but most of what is offered costs 99 cents and up. No skype or any of the popular FREE apps available for android or Apple and NO NETFLIX!!!!!! You can't even watch in the browser because there is no silverlight support. Don't be fooled by the reviews that say \"it now has android support\". This means nothing because you are limited by blackberry's weak application offerings....there is no android market here.I spent $199 for this and it doesn't get much use (my ipad gets used often). Battery life sucks with the playbook (3 hours max) and my tablet arrived with one green stuck pixel which looks lovely on a black background.The browser does play flash well however flash enabled sites often become tiresome to navigate because of the limited screen space and tiny controls. An example of this would be zillow.com. Try pinch, zoom, and scroll without opening advertisements or other content. Unless you have dainty hands it's impossible. Another reason applications are important, so the user can easily control what they are trying to accomplish.This review comes post install of the 2.0 update which has been waited for with bated breath by many and was suppose to \"change everything\" in terms of this tablet's usability (or lack thereof). With the 2.0 update you get a native mail app and buggy \"android support\". Pretty insulting for my $200 dollar investment.The volume (sound volume) rocker on top of the device lags horribly. Push the up or down buttons to change the loudness, and the effect happens 5-6 seconds later, along with a volume slider bar that appears on screen. You either end up turning the volume way too high or way too soft because of this.The OS software on the playbook takes about 3 or 4 minutes to boot up. Quite possibly the longest boot times in mainstream computing history. Reminds me of the old days with windoze 98 on an i386.These are my observations about the device based on my usage, and in comparison to the iPad/iOS and Android powered tablets (of which I also own). Some people seem giddy with excitement about the playbook while others are in my camp of disappointment  (based on review readings here and elsewhere) so your mileage may very based on your level of standards, and whether or not you are a RIM fanboy or employee (the not-so-good reviews for this device are trolled by such people if you look closely)I have no allegiance to any device or company but this thing was clearly rushed to market. Lovely colors, smooth swiping, and 1080p mean nothing if utility is lacking. Software wise it's a joke, an expensive joke on ME. You can decide if the bargain basement price is enough to make the same mistake.If blackberry can fix the battery life and volume control with another update and give me Skype and Netflix for F R E E (don't nickel and dime me with your app world!!!!) then I'll change my review to 4 stars. The hardware has promise, The software as of today (even after the long awaited v2.0) does not.HINT: F R E E GPS software, to take advantage of the unutilized GPS capabilities of the playbook would get 5 stars.
